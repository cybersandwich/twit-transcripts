Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, how's it going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's actually the PHP factory, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's the PHP factory these days, yeah, but my bike is still there.  Still there.  Yeah, my bike's around the wall there.  But yeah, right now it is the PHP factory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  PHP and bicycles, together at last.  Also with us from Berlin, where he is on assignment.  I like saying that.  Jeff Jarvis.  Jeff is the author, no, not of The Complete Wave Guide.  That's Gina Tripani, completewaveguide.com.  Jeff is the author of What Would Google Do?  and blogsatbuzzmachine.com.  And why are you in Germany?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm giving talks to a whole mess of publishers here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ah, how fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Doing the good work of educating the world.  That's right.  About media.  Well, let's hope so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was screwed there.  How deep, what deep doo-doo they are in.  And we have a special guest with us today.  I'm really happy to welcome Chris Messina.  Factory Joe is here.  Howdy.  You just recently became open web advocate at Google.  We first met when you were working at Mozilla and you've done a lot of advocacy for OAuth  and other open standards.  And I think it's really cool that Google has hired you to continue that work.  FactoryJoe.com is his blog.  So how has it been working at Google?  You enjoying it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's terrific.  It's a lot of work.  But I was sort of anticipating that.  And I think it's really nice that Google's brought me in specifically to keep doing a  lot of the work that I was already doing.  And what I find is very interesting about the job now is that I'm actually doing a lot  of work on internal evangelism, I guess.  Sort of bringing a lot of the ideas that a lot of folks in the grassroots web community  have been working on for the last couple of years and socializing them internally, getting  people to find out more about them and then working with the folks at Google who are already  involved in things like OAuth and OpenID to, I guess, have a way of reaching out into the  community as well and kind of making that give and take happen a little more fluidly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, I think it's really encouraging that Google has somebody in this job.  I hope so.  That's pretty important.  Well, but you see companies like Facebook.  Again, I know you were pretty happy when Facebook decided to start using OAuth, but you look  at a company like Facebook that really does seem to want to create its own standards in  some ways.  It wants to do it its own way.  And compare and contrast that to Google that says, we're going to support these open standards  so that everybody can play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's an interesting challenge.  I've personally, I think, been developing a more nuanced understanding of how a lot  of these things both play out in the real world and how you can get big companies to  move to adopt things that are more conventional.  I think the name of the game over a good amount of time is figuring out the right story for  interoperability.  And what that means is that you have to find the right balance between inventing something  that's brand new and imposing that upon sort of like the world versus adopting or making  use of technologies that already exist, that have communities that are built around them,  and that have gone through a lot of the, as we call, bike shedding process of figuring  out what to call this variable and what to call that protocol and things like that.  But what I also am finding is that, and I train as a designer in college, that we also  do a lot of work to make these technologies easier for people who are new to developing  on the web platform and who don't want to spend their time reading all these mailing  lists.  So on the one hand, you can give Facebook some slack for inventing some things.  On the other hand, they've done a pretty good job actually with a lot of their developer  documentation and making it very clear and very simple.  So it sort of puts a charge, I think, to the open web community in general to figure out  how we can make our things as approachable and easy to implement and adopt as some of  the things that are more proprietary or single company oriented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  I know Gina probably has a few things that she would like to ask and say, so Gina, ask  away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I guess I was just curious about sort of the current, like what your thoughts  are on the Facebook sign in issue.  So they're implementing OAuth or not?  Yeah.  They are?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook Connect is OAuth?  What Facebook is doing, and I can only speak in terms of what they've publicly said, of  course, they're basing the next rev of Facebook login and I guess they're deprecating the  Facebook Connect brand on OAuth 2.0.  And there's some important distinctions that are worth bringing up in terms of understanding  the difference between OAuth 1.0 and OAuth 2.0.  And it's probably even worth providing a little bit of background and history about where  OAuth actually came from.  Specifically, it's a good example of a grassroots community coming together to solve a problem  that a number of, in this case, startups had and working together to solve a common problem  that none of them really wanted to compete on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We could go back in time and look at single sign on solutions from like Microsoft, like  Passport.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We could.  It's a little bit different than that though.  Actually, some of the early OAuth stuff actually came from a problem that we had with OpenID.  So I've been involved with the OpenID community for some time.  And of course, OpenID is a technology that allows you to use an account that you have  on one website on another website without having to create a new password.  And it does so in a secure way.  However, it requires a browser.  And that meant that if you wanted to use OpenID with, let's say, an API, or if you wanted  to use your OpenID to sign into a dashboard widget, for example, it didn't work.  So we needed a way of essentially getting another way to identify users in APIs and  things like that.  And the solution that seems to be the common one is to substitute tokens, essentially keys  and secrets, in place of a username and password for people so they can actually access things  via APIs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is where some of my confusion.  So OpenID does not equal OAuth.  OAuth is not a tokenized version of OpenID.  They're completely separate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They are completely separate.  They are complements.  And the way that OpenID works is that you have an identity provider on the one hand  and you have a relying party on the other hand.  And the terminology is a little bit dorky.  But the basic idea is that you have some other website that you want to log into that is  willing to rely on the identity provider, the one who basically says this is factoryjo.com.  You should trust me because I'm asserting that that's his identity.  And the other site basically says, OK, I'm willing to rely on you to tell me who the  user is.  And it's all done using math and crypto and all this crazy stuff.  But it's just an identity solution.  It's an identity technology.  So it's basically a way of uniquely identifying people.  On the other hand, OAuth sort of ignores the identity piece.  It doesn't care who is kind of involved in that transaction.  Instead, it's a way of securely sending messages back and forth using tokens and signatures  as a way of verifying that, yes, this message that was sent from point A to point B is actually  from that original place.  It hasn't been tampered with.  And we can send messages back and forth in a secure manner.  And I'll say one thing.  And it's not decentralized.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like OpenID, you have a website.  There's a third party involved, which verifies your identity.  But with OAuth, the tokens are from an originator, one single centralized originator, right?  It's not a sign that you can use around the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Correct.  The way that I'll describe, I guess, the difference there, and this is kind of an interesting  — there's a lot of very interesting and deep conversations about this now, because  I think both OAuth and especially OAuth 2.0 and OpenID 2.0 are at a crossroads where we're  very quickly trying to define the future of these technologies and how they complement  one another.  Because what we found, to your point about OAuth, is that most implementations, of course,  they rely on pre-registration.  What that means is that if you have a web application or if you have a desktop application, you  have to go to, let's say, Twitter and get a unique key so that whenever people use your  application, Twitter can know, OK, this is that application making a call on behalf of  this user.  And so we're going to look up those tokens and make sure that it's all good and we're  going to let that tweet go through or what have you.  And if anything goes wrong with that application, then Twitter has the ability to revoke the  unique key that identifies the application.  So it is centralized and it's sort of a pairwise coupling in that sense.  OpenID, in contrast, has a feature called discovery.  And what that means is when I type in a web address into an OpenID box, let's say, that  back to whatever I typed in the box to essentially log into that website.  And then my identity provider will then bounce me back with the right encryption stuff that  says, yep, that person logged in.  It's cool.  This is the user and this is the ID that you should use.  You should know them by.  So what we're seeing happen, though, and I think this is the thing that's very interesting,  is that people are starting to use OAuth for identity-based transactions.  So what that means is that when you go to a website and it says, sign in with Twitter,  they're actually using OAuth.  That website is pre-registered with Twitter.  And when Twitter signs you in, basically Twitter passes back your unique Twitter ID so that  website basically has your unique identifier, which could have been an OpenID, being sent  through OAuth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So just to make it so that people who are listening are a little confused, not as developers,  my experience has been, now that Twitter has adopted OAuth, if I want to use a third-party  client, I no longer enter my Twitter credentials into that third-party client.  I request authorization.  It sends a token to Twitter, or actually logs me in, it sends me to the Twitter site.  And then Twitter says, okay, well, Twitlator or TweetDeck is asking for authorization.  Is it okay?  You say yes.  It then sends you back to the third-party client, which says, you're authorized now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  And what's happening in the background there is that all these applications need some sort  of username and password, essentially again a key which uniquely identifies you and a  secret which only you should know or only Twitter should know.  So in the case of using OAuth and providing authorization, what you're essentially doing  is you're saying, hey, Twitter, there's this application and it's Tweety for the Mac or  something, which of course doesn't use OAuth yet.  But anyways, pretend it does.  Bad choice.  Pretend it does.  The idea is that Twitter will then say, okay, cool, do you want to authorize that application?  You're like, yes, I do.  And in the background, of course, the user doesn't see this part.  Twitter.com then sends a token and a key or whatever back to the application, which substitutes  for your username and password.  So that way you as a user can actually deauthorize that application at a later point without  having to change your master password for your account.  Love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have real control.  And that's been very useful when I quit Facebook, for instance.  I can eliminate any connections to Facebook by going to these other sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the issue is now that people are using that, now you're seeing that sign in with  Twitter kind of around the web, Twitter is becoming the arbiter of your identity.  You're saying Twitter is the one asserting you are who you are, which is fine, which  is cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Only when you want to use a Twitter service though, right?  So Flickr does it when I want to use a Flickr service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not like OpenID.  I still have my OpenID on my site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  And that's what I really like about OpenID is that it's your domain.  The problem is that people often don't have their own domain.  Right.  What do you do?  OpenID.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And this begs the question, why isn't Google doing this in Google profiles or something  like that?  This would be a very logical place for Google profiles to step up and say, hey, you could  put your OpenID here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Explain what you mean by that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I don't know what I mean by that actually.  For OpenID, I'm using ClaimID.  You use a third party authorizing site and then on your own site you put a link back  to that.  Maybe what Google should be doing, maybe it does.  I don't know.  Will Google act as an OpenID provider?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does.  It does.  In fact, you can use your own domain as your OpenID, but then you can do what's called  delegation to OpenID.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I could delegate to Google then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right.  So it's sort of like saying redirect.  Whenever I try to log in with this domain, redirect to Google and then Google will actually  do the authentication bit and then allow you to sign in.  But you're still identified as your domain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that was a crazy thing I just asked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it was perfectly reasonable.  It's just not a full size.  No, it was reasonable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't realize that you could.  I actually haven't set up.  I'm using like ClaimID or something like that like you, Leo.  I haven't set up an OpenID on my own domain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where do I go to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, so if you can edit the source code on your website, then you can add essentially  two meta tags.  If you search for OpenID delegation, you should be able to find it.  It's very simple.  It should take you like five minutes maybe at most.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I can replace ClaimID with Google.  And my Google credential becomes my OpenID credential.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not exactly.  And this is where it gets a little hokey.  It actually is quite simple in terms of the actual practice and how it works.  But what you're doing is you're essentially saying whenever a relying party sees this  OpenID, I want you to bounce over to this other website to get the actual authentication  verification, I guess.  So yeah, you are kind of using your Google credential as your account, but you're still  logging in with your OpenID URL.  So let me finish on the point.  What that allows you to do is to own your own domain.  And if at one point in your life you choose to point to ClaimID to be your OpenID provider,  you might choose to delegate to Google or to somebody else entirely.  And you still use the same OpenID to log in all these different services.  So that's one of the things that I really liked about OpenID from the very beginning  is that it allows me to own my own domain and sort of have a choice of who provides  my identity.  And I can swap it out at any time that I want to without having to go and change the account  that I'm using on all these other remote websites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I send when I log in, I send, I add leoville.com, my personal domain, but I can change at leoville.com  who the delegated OpenID provider is.  Can you have multiple?  Can you have multiple or you can only have one at a time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can do what's called creating fallbacks.  So if for whatever reason ClaimID is down, then the idea is that the site that you're  signing into would then ping the next one in line.  So maybe after ClaimID is down, it goes to Google.  But you're still verifying that you own your domain.  And that's the whole sort of design principle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there any kind of higher level than of identity verification such that, let's say,  Twitter verifies that Roger Ebert is Roger Ebert and that they've gone to that effort  to know that it's a real name with a real ID with this ID?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  There are a couple different ways to do this today.  Unfortunately, OAuth is, I don't want to say it's lacking in this, but it hasn't really  gone in this direction yet.  For OpenID, there's an extension that's called the Policy Assurance Provider Extension,  PAPE.  It's PAPE.  It's again, naming is not our forte, apparently.  Anyways, with PAPE, what you can do is you can essentially allow the identity provider  to assert how the user was authenticated.  So it can say things like, we used a phishing resistant mechanism to authenticate this user,  or this user used biometrics to log in, or this user used a one-time password.  And you can do things like that that provide a mechanism to at least have some sense for  the level of assurance, essentially, that the identity provider is offering.  Now, it's up to the relying party, of course, to trust that the identity provider is not  lying, but that's what makes it a relying party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the question is that if we got to a point where somebody, let's say, I don't know,  a post office or a bank started to verify to real name or a credit account or an address  or something like that, then if we trusted that party, the rest of the system works so  that we know how that party operates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so there's a couple pieces that you're asking there, and there's some mechanisms  that are also in place to do this, too.  So there's an organization that was started, I believe it was last, maybe last summer,  or maybe it was, anyways, recently, called the Open Identity Exchange.  And this was an initiative that was started by the Open ID Foundation and the InfoCard  Foundations together working with the federal government to create what's called an open  trust framework.  And an open trust framework essentially is kind of an agreement, a deal that identity  providers could essentially sign up for and opt into on a voluntary basis.  They can say, we do these various things to make sure that our users have gone through  a process of either validation or verification or whatever it happens to be.  And in that case, those identity providers that have gone through that trust framework,  and they also, of course, say, you know, and we won't monitor what our users are doing  or whatever it happens to be, those accounts in that context will be able to be used to  authenticate to government websites and government services.  Now, that's one piece of the puzzle.  The other piece is something that's called, I guess, attribute exchange or the ability  to have verified attributes that are attached to an identifier of some sort.  And there might be attribute providers, of course, that can basically say with some authority,  yep, this person is a US citizen, or yep, this person lives in California.  And those things become very valuable, of course, over time, but we're not quite there  in terms of where maybe we'd like to be.  But it's definitely coming, I think, and it's pretty exciting stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That makes sense.  This is great stuff, and I would like to continue with it, but I also want to make sure we get  some other stuff in here as well.  It's so great to have Chris Messina on and actually hear this story directly.  You guys, we can do a couple more if you or, Jeff, you or Gina have additional questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I'm good.  I'm actually, I'm setting up my meta tags now and I'm moving to the new Facebook API  because I was using the old Facebook Connect, but now I have a reason.  So I'm good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you're saying you're using as your open ID provider Facebook or you're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was using, I think, Yahoo.  Yahoo is a provider.  It was a while ago and I always wanted to just use my own domain and I never took the  time to look up how to do it because I thought I was going to have to install some sort of  server.  I didn't realize that you could do the delegate thing, which is very, very cool.  And it literally is two meta tags.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can even literally go to my homepage and you could view source and see the tags that  I've got there and basically, you know, just make sure that you use your own open ID provider  because you won't be able to authenticate as me, but that would be where to go to find  out how to do this.  I was just looking.  Is there a plugin for WordPress or something like that for us?  In fact, there is.  There's a very good one.  And the person who wrote that plugin is sitting next to me now, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  If you search for the open ID WordPress plugin, you can find it.  It acts both as a open ID provider, which is pretty cool, but it also acts as a relying  party.  So that means that people can use their open IDs to sign into your website and leave authenticated  comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ah, that's interesting.  This is it.  Will Norris and Factory Joe, in fact, are the authors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's cool.  So I've just been doing it with meta tags, but it sounds like this would add some features  that I probably should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, so now this is interesting.  And this is sort of an interesting point about open ID as well.  If you want to provide your own open ID, great.  Do it.  However, for me, and I'm not really the developer at all.  I just play one on the internet.  I would prefer to have someone else actually be responsible for managing my open ID credentials  and login and security and things like that.  The delegation thing is a very simple, very low cost, very easy way of actually relying  on someone else.  You can totally run your own open ID provider with the open ID WordPress plugin.  And if you want to do that, do it.  But I would recommend getting SSL on your site and making sure that you're pretty confident  about being able to manage WordPress and keeping all the security up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is not delegation.  This is actually making you an open ID provider.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right.  So you can actually become an open ID provider for many people if you have a multi-user blog,  for example.  What's the for dummies version?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't want to do this, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, what's the for dummies version?  That's why I want to be able to go to Google and say, identify me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You want to delegate to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you want to delegate.  So you want to use the tags.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's just two lines.  It's pretty easy to do.  I know.  And if you're doing it in WordPress, you'd put it in your template in something that gets  loaded every time the template gets loaded.  Usually that would be your header.  Yes.  And it's just too, I can email you.  I could type it into a text message.  It's that simple.  It's very cool.  And you know what?  We will put in our show notes, Ken Sheppardson just posted a blog post from robboak.com.  But this is one of many links.  There's a lot of them on using your Google account as your open ID provider for your  blog.  It's very straightforward.  Super.  Yeah.  And he's got just all the text you need in here.  That's cool.  That's a very simple thing to do.  All right.  But we do need to move on.  So, in this week's Google News in just a little bit, I was able a little earlier to order  an iPhone, I'm sad to say.  You actually got through the process?  I actually got through it.  Well, I wanted to see.  That's amazing.  Good for you.  Yeah.  Now my wallet's lightened by $761 because I didn't qualify.  Because I make the mistake of buying one every time Apple dangles it in front of my eyes.  We'll talk about that in all the Google-y news in just a little bit.  We got to take a little break.  If you guys want to take a bio break, please feel free.  You got a minute?  I'm going to talk about GoToAssist and gotoassist.com.  This is from my great friends at Citrix.  GoToAssist is a system that will allow you to become your tech support wizard for your  family or friends.  Or better yet, if you're in the business of tech support or you support some software,  this will make you a tech support hero.  You can try it free for 30 days.  Go to gotoassist.com slash twig for the 30-day free trial.  It's based on the remote access capabilities that Citrix is famous for.  Of course, they got to go to my PC, go to meeting the Citrix enterprise, but it adds  special features for tech support.  In fact, you could use this.  I could use this with you, Jeff.  I could use this to go to your system.  I don't know.  I could screw you up real good.  Maybe I better not do that.  Go to gotoassist.com slash twig.  You get up to eight sessions at once, unattended support.  It's very easy.  In fact, even if your supportees don't yet have it installed, you just send them a link  or say go to gotoassist.com and they put the information in and suddenly you're in there.  You're modifying their system.  You're fixing their system.  You're making it work.  You can drag and drop patches and fixes from your system to theirs.  It'll even give you an assay of what operating system, what security software, everything's  running in the background.  Try it free, 30 days.  Go to assist.com slash twig.  We thank them so much for their support for this week in Google.  So we were, I see a post here from you, Jeff, on the Google operating system, Chrome OS.  Google's done so well with Android.  I still wonder if it's not just right-hand, left-hand.  It's just two different groups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know that I get the strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've become such Android fans.  In fact, one of the reasons I ordered the iPhone is only because my HTC Nexus One handset.  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, Leo.  Well, I can't say I'm going to the iPhone because we talked you out of yours, Jeff.  The dog ate my Android.  I'm just going to try it, Jeff.  I'm just going to try it.  I still love my Nexus One.  In fact, running Froyo 2.2 is just awesome.  I still don't have it.  It didn't push it out to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it hasn't pushed out yet.  It should.  Well, that's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It should soon.  You're on T-Mobile, right, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, T-Mobile should work very well in Berlin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, because my account doesn't really do that, so I signed on for Truphone.  Ah.  And I'm going to try that here.  Ah.  But otherwise, I'm using the iPhone.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, my problem with Nexus One and others have had this problem is that the...  And I think this is the one thing I don't like about Android is this top switch that you, you know, wake the thing up with.  It died.  And of course, I can't wake the phone up.

Transcript:  Wake up!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know it's there.  I know it's alive.  The little ball will blink.  If I connect it to USB, my...  Oh.  So it has power and everything.  Well, yeah, so what I did is I popped the battery because I thought, well, maybe it's a software thing.  Popped the battery, and now I can't turn on the phone.  It won't go on.  So now I know it's a switch, it's not software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I got to do a sign in your Evo and everything will be there.  So that's the good news.  I do love that feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do love that feature.  So are you using the Evo now more?  Gina got both, of course, from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I'm actually still sticking with the Nexus One for now.  I really like Froyo and a friend of mine is sticking up behind the Evo, so I gave him the Evo to kind of test drive for a little while.  Yeah, so...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like the Evo, but same with you, as you say, I decided to stick with the Nexus One.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Still waiting for... did you really ever play with the Incredible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, and I think if I were going to go with Verizon, I would absolutely get an Incredible.  But I need GSM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know, I really need GSM.  That's the thing.  If you travel, for sure.  Yeah.  So it looks like Chrome OS is coming out Q4 this year.  And did you hear about Chromoting?  This is a word that I'm kind of obsessed with right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Chromoting?  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Chromoting.  Someone dug up on one of the Google mailing lists about Chrome OS that it's going to have this feature that they're calling right now Chromoting.  It's not the official feature name, but it's basically Remote Desktop.  So you can remote desktop into another PC and use applications there.  Built-in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Built-in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  From Chrome OS, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's interesting.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's kind of...  What's another kind of cloud thing?  Except your cloud is in your whole machine, not in the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's an internal personal cloud.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  It's interesting though, because it kind of makes devices that run Chrome OS kind of a compliment to another device.  This is kind of my thing with the iPad is that it's a peripheral.  You know what I mean?  You have to connect it to something.  I mean, at least initially.  Right?  I mean, it's kind of built to sync with another machine.  It's not like you could buy an iPad necessarily and just use it.  Although if you synced it once, you could.  But Chrome OS kind of struck me too.  Is Chrome OS one of the options for a new Google employee as one of their operating systems?  What's the story there, Chris?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  About which part?  About the new options?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What operating systems were you offered when you started?  Chris is like, can I say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was offered a PC, Mac or Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you did have a choice.  And Colleen, who went over there just a month ago, said she was only given Mac or Linux as a choice.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Chrome OS wasn't a choice.  It's not mature enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You couldn't do anything with Chrome OS yet.  Yeah.  Really.  I'm glad it's coming along.  Why not?  The more the merrier.  That is great.  Yeah.  I love it.  I love it.  I use, by the way, it's basically Chrome, right?  I mean, you do everything through Chrome, no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, this is sort of like the story of the web as a platform.  Right.  I think it's pretty exciting to see that.  You know, it's interesting.  And it's kind of worth bringing up.  I did some work last fall with Mozilla before I joined Google.  And this has been something that's been very challenging in a lot of the stuff that I've worked on.  I don't know if you know, but I was one of the co-founders of Flock, the social browser, which I guess just came out with a new story today, which is actually being, you know, now they're being built on Chromium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, because they were a Mozilla browser.  Yeah.  That's a big story.  I'm very happy about that.  That's a huge shift.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can actually download the new beta, which is Windows only, unfortunately, so I can't try it.  But actually, if you go to beta.flock.com, you should be able to find it.  But anyways, the point is that what I think is interesting about what's going on with this stuff is this confluence, or I guess the nexus of the browser and the OS.  And one of the things that I've been working on a lot, and we started the conversation with this, is around identity and where identity should sort of exist.  Should it live in a browser or should it live in the OS?  And what is the difference between the two?  And especially if you have a shared computing device, do you log into the browser, which then logs you into all your web services, or do you log into the operating system, which then logs you into the browser, which then logs you into all your web services?  So with Chrome OS, I think one of the cool ideas is to be able to log into the OS, which also logs you into all your web services.  And now you can sort of not worry about managing passwords and all that other stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's kind of like how Android works, right?  I mean, you kind of sign in with different accounts, your Facebook account, your Gmail account, your Google account, and then things just work, right?  Because they know it logs you in automatically.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to try the new Flock.  I was always a fan of Flock.  Flock is a social browser that is at browser level logging you into all your accounts.  But that's how you use FriendFeed, Facebook, Twitter, Flickr.  You use it in a browser.  It's the only way you would use it, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing about the browser, too, is that it's, of course, the one application that you use that kind of knows all of your accounts, knows all your passwords.  So you have to trust it a whole lot.  And the fact that the browser hasn't really changed in even the last decade, even since Firefox came out, to try to understand you and your profiles and your personas as you go across the web and how you behave differently and use different accounts or different names in different places, I think is a huge opportunity and something that I hope we see, I guess, more thought and more innovation on, especially with mobile devices, whether it's a Chrome OS or Chrome tablet or it's an iPad or whatever it's going to be.  The ability to just pick up a device, sign into it and have all of your friends and all your services available to you without having to sign into each one incrementally, I think is going to be a major innovation.  It's extremely important for the future of making this stuff more accessible to a wider audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess I was the last person in the world still using Google Web Alerts.  I don't.  I use them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I use them.  That's my vanity search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's how I check to see how I'm doing in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What people are saying about you.  What are they saying about me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it turns out it was just you and me, Gina.  I actually use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A friend of mine is involved in a court case and I have a news alert for any news around it.  So I actually don't use it just for ego stuff, although I do use it for ego stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So last week, Google announced it's not going to offer alerts for web search results.  We'll replace them with comprehensive alerts that includes web and Google News and Blog.  Marcel Gordon, who is the project manager for Google Alerts, says Web Alerts weren't very popular.  So what's the difference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a very, very subtle difference.  So it's just web search results versus results for everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's what I thought I was getting anyway, was everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, if you had your alert just set to web, it's going to get switched to everything,  which means you might get a few more alerts.  And if you do, you can just adjust the frequency or whatever.  But yeah, I mean, they're just kind of paring down the options, which seems reasonable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really just simplification.  It's not really a loss of functionality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, the simplification is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was scared for a minute.  Yeah, I've had it type everything I think anyway, because I want everything anybody says about me.  I want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the conversation. It's not pure ego. It's conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, in my case, it's pure ego.  That's how I justify it.  Yeah, it's conversation. It's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What upsets me is that there is absolutely no way that I can find to use Tech-N-Rati the way I used to use it, which was just that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I miss that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, I used to use Tech-N-Rati the first time.  Why does it exist? What does it do? I have no idea.  Yeah.  We should get Gabe on and he can explain it to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google researcher gives Microsoft five days to fix XP zero-day bug.  We were talking about this on Security Now yesterday.  Now we should let you know it's only Windows Server 2003 and XP, but a Google engineer today published an attack code that exploits a zero-day vulnerability.  I don't think he did it under the auspices of Google.  Travis Ormandy is a security worker for Google in Switzerland.  He says, hey, I told him five days ago, this has always been an issue in the security community is how long you give an operating system or company to fix the flaw before you publicize it.  And in some cases, it could be six months.  I know when I was talking to Matt Conyer from WooWoo, he said there's been...I love the name of these companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, how could you say that with a straight face?  WooWoo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why? I'm not from WooWoo.  They're good security companies.  He said, we know of an Apple flaw that they haven't fixed in a year.  This was some years ago, but they haven't fixed in a year.  And I think there are considerable Apple flaws that are partially from the open source software and the Darwin layer that just have been hanging out there for ages.  Everybody knows about them, but Apple just doesn't fix them.  We just got a big Apple 200 megabyte push today.  So nothing much to say about it.  I guess that's not really a Google story, but except for this connection to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's not really Google versus Microsoft, right?  No.  This person didn't post as a Google employee trying to shame Microsoft, right?  I mean, he's a security guy.  He just happens to be a researcher for Google.  It seemed...I mean, he let them know...  I mean, you have to kind of assume that people who are trying to exploit Windows PCs know about the exploit.  They already know.  That's the theory.  It's kind of better, right, that everyone knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  After a while, the bad guys know, so now it's really time to step up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's a protocol for this too.  I mean, and I think that the protocol is more or less followed where you do give proper notice  and enough time so that changes can be made and fixes can be rolled out.  And then if they don't, then that's more and more time where that vulnerability is kind of out there unpatched.  So it's hard to say that they did anything wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Five days is fast, but that's the only issue.  Google said his personal views and disclosure don't reflect the views of his colleagues  or Google's stance on disclosure as a whole.  So he's working on his own.  Much more serious headache for Google.  The issue of this, and I think it's a bogus issue.  I think every security expert agrees, of this collection of private data from Wi-Fi networks.  Google, just to update you if you haven't heard the story,  Google when it was sending its Street View cars around was also mapping Wi-Fi access points  as you would completely expect it to do, matching SSIDs to MAC addresses.  And in the process, gathering some data only on unencrypted Wi-Fi access spots,  that data being useful in this process.  However, when they were doing a survey, an assay of what they were up to in Germany,  I think it was where there are serious anti-Street View privacy concerns,  they discovered this was being snapped.  These snippets of data were being collected.  They revealed it.  Have they turned the information over to Germany?  I'm not sure yet if they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they finally did.  Part of the problem was that evidently the way I hear it in Germany was that Google was first asked  and said that they didn't respond and then it came up later.  But they're wacky about this here. They're just wacky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we're about to be wacky here in the States.  30 separate states' Attorneys General are now looking into whether Google violated any laws  with the Street View mapping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, this is the thing. They're all like, we just, we, there better be a law here that's getting broken.  We just have to figure out which one it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And we should point out, first of all, that this data is very fragmentary because it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no possible use or the chances that there's anything that's personally identifiable  and informative in that is nil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And incidentally, these were all unencrypted.  I mean, this data is being sent out in non-fragmentary fashion all the time by these access points.  And anybody who wanted to sit outside and camp outside could capture it easily.  Richard Blumenthal started this Connecticut's Attorney General.  He says, violating legitimate expectations of privacy on the part of both homeowners and business people  is an extraordinarily serious issue. This is all just campaigning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, okay, fine. I mean, I get the point.  I get the point. It's like you don't expect that a car driving by your home is recording the data being transferred over your open network.  Fine. That's true. Okay. You have that expectation that's not happening.  And there was one issue that was brought up that the codes, the mistaken code that dealt with this data dumped the encrypted data, but logged the unencrypted data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because the encrypted data is garbage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, right. It's just, right. It can't be used in any way.  It can't be used in any way.  But this is the point that someone that this new story is making was like, if this was really just a mistake, why was the code even differentiating between the encrypted and unencrypted?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because that's the sensible thing to do. I think they were using, not Wireshark, they were using, what was the program they were using?  It's just a common open source capture program for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Gina's saying that why would you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because the program knows that the encrypted data is random nonsense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but why would you keep the unencrypted data at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, because SSIDs, you need the packets for SSIDs and other information is in the packet.  So you can, what's happening is you're driving along.  So it comes along with ride.  Yeah, you're driving along very fast, taking pictures and...  I hope you don't drive like that.  It's like Mr. Toad's wild ride.  There's some crap off.  You're driving along. And so what you're also doing is you're saying SSID, you know, I see access point, access point.  By the way, for purposes of geolocation, which is what this is all about, encrypted or unencrypted doesn't matter.  But you capture these packets and apparently it was a Kismet. Yeah, it was Kismet.  Apparently, you know, what they were doing is not trying to match the GPS information to the SSID or MAC address information in real time.  Why bother? Just you record to the hard drive, GPS, GPS, GPS, what kind of garbage is coming in?  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, as you're going down the road.  Now, maybe Kismet smart enough to say, well, I know I'm not going to get any good information out of the encrypted packets.  So I'm just not even going to save them, not going to waste the hard drive space.  Then they later. Now, the mistake, they probably should should have thrown this data out after they did the crunching.  Right. But I think that was an error.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think it was like what about this report that it was a rogue employee?  This was the this was the thing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're saying it was a rogue employee.  It wasn't just some sort of it just wasn't an innocent mistake because it was dumping the encrypted data, but not keeping the unencrypted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, you know, that that was the that was kind of the anybody who's smart enough to use this knows that they're not getting anything of value at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, well, this is the issue. Right.  Like what, you know, I mean, if I were Google and I really want to record what people did on their networks, I would do it through like Google DNS.  I mean, I would do it in a much.  Gmail.  They have so much they have your history.  They have so many other better channels to collect data about you if they really wanted to.  And it does seem like what could they possibly do with these fragments of data from these networks?  I don't I don't know. I don't know.  I mean, I I suppose why.  We are.  I have seen over here in Germany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just awful because I'll come in defending Google and get shot at every every media I go to and media is just Google mad.  Even though, again, Germany has the largest penetration of anywhere in the world, 90 some percent penetration by the actual people, the government are going Google wacky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it would be as if the Google Street cars rolled down the street with an open microphone and recorded ambient sound.  Right.  I mean, what would they be wacky about that here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They go back.  Last night, I gave a talk in Munich and some guys said basically they were looking at somebody's iPad and said, well, I see my pictures there on the iPad.  It was transmitted. I said, you're in a public place.  Yeah, come on.  You have the rights to do that.  I think so.  What are you going to require that you can't take a picture of anyone anywhere on life now unless you go up and get their their legal sign off?  It's absurd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apparently somebody took a picture of Marissa Meyer.  And it's true.  We'll talk about that in just a little bit.  There's a tease.  There's a tease for you.  Before we do that, I want to talk a little bit about one of our great sponsors, a new sponsor.  We're really glad to have them.  I've been looking for a while for the best place to do domain name registration.  And I know that for a lot of people, that's something that we're looking for a better company to do this with.  Not the cheapest necessarily, although it is the same price as most of these other guys, but one that's going to give you great service.  That's going to not bog you down with 50 clicks before you can buy.  And I found it hover.com.  They've been around for a while.  I've used to two cast for registration before.  This is two cast new site hover H.O.V.E.R. dot com.  It's all about making domain registration and service absolutely easy.  You don't get barraged with pages and pages of upsell offers.  They make it easy to register.  They used to be domains direct.  They they've rebranded it to hover dot com.  And if you use hover Monday through Friday, nine a.m. to eight p.m. Eastern and you want to get customer service, there is a new no hold policy.  You will call and someone will answer.  And that's it.  They won't put you on hold.  That's Monday during business hours, Monday through Friday, nine a.m. to eight p.m. Eastern.  Simple name, simple place to go.  You can go twit dot hover dot com.  You get 10 percent off your next domain name registration if you use them.  And we have moved all of our sites over.  And I have to say clean, easy to use twit dot hover dot com.  We thank them so much for their support.  The great these are great people.  I've known these guys for a long time and I was really glad that we could get them on the on the shows and on the network.  You can go twit dot hover dot com 10 percent off your next domain name registration and none of that upselling garbage.  So Marissa Meyer is riding in a limo, a limo coach, a bus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what's a bus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And somebody snaps her picture.  And then somehow it gets into a stock photography and is now part of an ad for a 14 passenger stretch Hummer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She was she was a bridesmaid at her brother's wedding in Minneapolis.  Like she's part of the wedding party.  So somehow one of the photos turned up in like an ad.  It looks like an ad.  It's an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The funny thing is you cannot there's no anonymity anymore.  Your picture snaps.  Somebody will see it somewhere say that looks like Marissa Meyer and they tweeted it.  The tweet was something like pretty sure I just spotted Marissa Meyer in a stocking wedding photo on a Web site and Marissa admits it.  Yeah, that was me.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  She handled it really well.  What are you going to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  What are you going to say?  She said, you know, a nice spot.  Smiley face.  Limo ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just you know, I think it's great too.  That's just she's a real person.  Yeah, she is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's see.  Google Music Store.  Are we excited about this?  It looks like fall now for the Google Music Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If it makes music on Android better, then yes.  Very excited.  And that's probably the best way to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  It'll be an Android feature or streaming to Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think streaming to Android would be a really huge, big, exciting deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I still haven't moved podcasts to Android.  How is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Easy.  I mean, this is the thing.  I use Double Twist, which is free, Mac or Windows, Double Twist.com.  It's DVD John's new business.  It looks just like iTunes.  It does podcasts.  It does audio.  It does video.  It gets your iTunes playlists and even syncs those.  And you can buy music in Amazon.  MP3, yeah.  So it's got a store.  I don't know.  What more could Google Music do?  I don't know.  It just seems like this is, to me, this is all I really need.  And so you can subscribe to podcasts.  You can even install Android apps from here, which I really like.  So the Android market is there and there's apps and you just install them.  It's just like iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Anyway, that's...  So now you manage your podcast through Double Twist, Leo?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, no, I use Listen.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I use Listen.  I use Listen, too.  This is all I need, really.  I just don't connect my phone to my computer very much because I don't really have to.  The only time I do it actually is when I need to sync music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the reason I do is because the USB charge port here at the office is connected to the  computer.  And if you put Double Twist...  By the way, this should be my tool of the week, but it isn't.  But if there's an Android app called Double Twist and if you put that on, then it automatically  goes into USB mode when you connect.  The Double Twist app on the Android is a very nice music player, but it also just kind of  says, wake up Double Twist.  And so it gets more and more like iTunes all the time.  I like it.  And by the way, one of the reasons I like it for podcasts is because one of the most  popular podcasts on here.  Nice.  I was reading Twig.  And Twig is on there as well.  So we have friends.  We have friends at Double Twist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just typed in Double Twist into my Android phone and it suggested socialist.  Socialist?  I downloaded an earthquake app this week because my house was shaking and I was like...  You're in San Diego.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right.  You had an earthquake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the earthquake app is very good, by the way.  And there are a lot of earthquakes around the world.  Often I wasn't aware of this until I installed the earthquake app.  It's very cool.  It's actually by a Google Android developer advocate.  Oh, neat.  I think his name is.  But yeah, it's a pretty cool app.  So yes, that's what I was doing as the earth was shaking.  I was like, there's got to be an app for this.  I heard that there is an app for earthquake detection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's an app for that.  Oh, wait a minute.  Trademark Apple.  Never mind.  Forget I said that.  Forget I mentioned that.  You know, the really number one reason to use...  The thing I will...  If I end up using the iPhone that I will miss the most is the integration of Google Voice  with the Android operating system.  It just becomes the voicemail.  You can make Google Voice calls.  You can even say, you know, I have a set for any international call I make goes through  Google Voice, but you can have all your calls go through Google Voice.  It's just as nicely integrated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bikini Witch, one of the stories is Google Voice is integrated with Gmail as a web service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, how's that going to work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apparently, this is inside the firewall at Google right now.  I know Chris in the spot, but that's what that story says.  Chris?  Have you tried it?  Chris doesn't know nothing.  I know nothing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is always an issue when we have Google employees.  And we should say that when you're a Google employee and you come on this show, you come  as a private individual and we won't put you on the spot that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We should provide a gag you can just put in your mouth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There should be a universal signal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Zip it.  Zip, zip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Zip, zip.  You know, nothing.  This looks cool.  This is from the Google system dot blog spot dot com blog, the unofficial Google operating  system blog.  Google tests a new feature that makes Gmail chat more useful.  Users are able to make and receive Google Voice calls from Gmail.  So I guess it uses the chat that's in Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it says here, I just didn't realize this fairly obvious, I guess, but if you want  to call someone using Google Voice, you need a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now.  That's the weird thing about Google Voice is that what it does is it calls you.  It places it's like your secretary.  It places a call and then calls you with the call.  So if you don't have a phone, you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  So this obvious need for having the phone, which is great, because I never have my phone  at my desk and I always am like running dashing across the apartment because I hear it ringing  in the other room.  So it calls your Google chat.  So yeah, it looks like the way this would work is that it would ring your Google chat.  So I mean, that's great.  I mean, Google chat has voice chat now, right?  This would just this is Gizmo.  This is they bought Gizmo five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The other thing I heard, I can't find the darn clip.  I was looking for it again.  But one report had it.  And right now, Chris is going to swallow his tongue is that there was an effort to do a  Gizmo desktop app, but that the founders didn't want to do anything that was outside a browser.  They only want to do browser stuff.  They don't want to use separate apps.  So maybe this is a way to still handle the problem by incorporating with Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I still have Gizmo five.  I still have guy.  Does it still work?  I mean, I still have my Gizmo five app.  I should try it.  I haven't logged in in a while.  They didn't shut it down today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think that was the issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Gizmo is great because it's a sip client, which means you can use it with asterisk or  you know, it's a sip phone basically.  And I presume then that means that Google chat now is a sip client, which means maybe  I'm reading too much into this that you could use it with any sip provider.  We're in a we're in an interesting world.  I tell you when it comes to telecommunications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we're in a scary world.  Are you scared?  The rant I did last week about AT&T, I did on NPR's on the media this week.  It just I'm really just upset that the clock is back on the Internet.  I was talking to some publishers here in Germany and they're doing paid iPhone apps and I said,  watch out.  What's going to happen is if somebody really loves your iPad app, rather, and uses it  a lot, they're going to go over their limit on their phone bill and they're going to blame  you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's why you got this.  That's why I love things like Google Voice and SIP and Gizmo because it's going to disintermediate  all this and all these big telcos.  It's all going to be it's got to all be data at some point.  I know they don't like that idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but you're going to get charged extra for the data at AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're still getting your service from your telco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so you're still screwed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is why I was very disappointed that Google, even though they could have did not bid on  that 700 megahertz spectrum.  I want Google to go into the ISP business.  Do you think, I mean, would that make sense at some point?  That's really the thing that needs to be disintermediated.  We need to take it out of the hands of these private providers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that the white space space?  No, what's the white space spectrum?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not the white space spectrum.  It was the it was that old television, the UHF, VHF spectrum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the white space is what is what Larry and Sergey have been talking about as Wi-Fi  on steroids.  When is the fate of that settle as to whether it's going to be unlicensed or sold?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  That's a good question.  What is the frequency of this white space?  Where are we?  Where are we talking about?  FCC pressed to move on white space spectrum.  So the FCC is obviously going to have to do something about this.  Senators from both sides of the aisle pressuring the FCC to stop talking about what should and  could be done with the unused white spaces of unused spectrum and start enacting policy  to take advantage of it.  It is part of the national broadband plan.  They wanted to get this done.  One of one of 360 recommendations.  Right.  Broadband plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's that to me is the key is so key because what we had the solution to this is competition.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But should the government go into this competition?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they should open it up so that we have open competition.  And that's what Google's been saying.  Right now we have a quadrupley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  By the way, a new version of iTunes just came out moments ago.  iTunes 9.2 designed to sync with the iPhone to enjoy your favorite music, movies, TV shows,  books and more on the go.  I don't know if that means Wi-Fi sync.  Sync and read books with an iPhone or iPod touch, organize and sync PDF documents.  No, this is all the stuff they've been talking about.  I would love to see.  This is another advantage that Android phones have is the ability to sync over Wi-Fi with  things like Google Listen.  You don't have to cook it up to a computer.  I like that a lot.  You know what?  I'm going to stick with my next one.  I'm going to get it fixed.  The hell with it.  The hell with it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm going to come to the cottage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just want to see the display.  Yeah, come over and see the display and then leave without my iPhone.  Apple pre-orders for the iPhone on day one, which was yesterday, hit 600,000.  That's more orders than ever in the history of mankind.  The largest Apple pre-order, single day pre-order ever.  AT&T sold out all the devices it had allocated for early ordering so they turned it off.  I was just able this morning to buy one from Apple though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On their site?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  Yeah, it was back up now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I wonder how many sales they lost yesterday because their stuff was out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I tried to get through yesterday.  Couldn't.  Couldn't get through at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's six.  I think July 14 is the ship date.  That's what it says on mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What does that mean?  Does that mean I'll get it?  No, they always do that.  They ship it and then it sits in the UPS facility until when they're good and ready.  So it's still the 25th before we'll get it, I imagine.  Apple stores in San Francisco and New York staff recommended customers try ordering the  device later.  Later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They ordered it to pick up at the store but the fear is we're still going to have to go  wait in a stupid line even though it's pre-ordered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stores will open at 7am in case you want to get in the line early.  Apple loves this.  They love this.  They want you to wait in line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we just do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And yeah, you guys just do it.  It's amazing.  The power of this company to market is just truly amazing.  We're going to take a break and come back with our picks, our tools and our tips.  I should mention that this is actually an appropriate story.  We're about to do the Ford Sync ad that Ford, according to CNET, Ford owners like me with  sync enabled vehicles will be able to tap into Google Maps to download directions to  their cars before months end.  I'm sorry.  You know, you should run out and buy a Mustang right now.  Get a Fusion if you're sensitive to the environment.  If you need something big, get one of those Flexes.  The free send to sync feature announced Tuesday by Ford will let drivers send Google Maps  data from their Bluetooth enabled computers or mobile phones to their in-car sync systems.  Electronic directions are down.  But see, I already have turn by turn directions so I'm not sure how this changes it.  But I guess I get it from Google.  The route is calculated on the spot using the latest traffic information.  That's one of the neat things about sync is it has the latest traffic information as well.  So I have to say, I still, you know, sometimes people will do this.  They'll say, my producers when we were in Los Angeles yesterday for E3 printed out Google  Maps directions.  Well, now you just send them to the sync.  Map a destination at home, at work, wherever you have connectivity.  When you get in your car, it already knows where you want to go.  Boom!  If I might borrow a phrase from Steve Jobs.  Boom!  So, yeah, baby, I love this thing.  Now, if you haven't taken a look at Ford sync, I want you to go to syncmyridepodcast.com.  You can see all the features.  Of course, you have to have a Ford Lincoln or Mercury vehicle.  You can't just, you know, they don't have a third party aftermarket sync.  You got to buy it in the Ford.  But if you're in the market for a new car, make sure, make sure you take a look at that.  Look at the Ford sync in the car and or go to sync my ride podcast because it's just  great.  I mean, it's true hand and by the way, works with Android two hands free calling.  So, you know, one of the problems with the Android phone is it doesn't have built in  voice calling.  They've got that voice calling application, but you still need to do the phone and a lot  of Bluetooth stuff doesn't a lot of cars don't do.  You still have to pick up the phone.  That's not hands free in the in the sink in the Ford sync.  No, you don't have to touch.  I don't touch the phone.  I just I just pair my Android phone with sync.  And then from then on, I don't take my hands off the wheel or the eyes off the road.  It downloads a phone book so it knows all my contacts.  I press the button on the wheel.  I say phone.  I say call Jeff Jarvis in Berlin.  Boom, bam.  Just like that.  It's there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We all have to podcast more cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  From now on, we can podcast for cars exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All for Ford Mustang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's kind of cool.  What's kind of cool is I talked to Alan Mullally, the CEO of Ford at CES, and he kind of made  a good point.  I think Walt Mossberg made it first, though, that when you get into a car, you're kind  of you're suddenly disconnected from the world.  You go back to the 1950s where you're just not connected.  You're driving along.  That's fine.  You know, in terms of safety, we one of the problems is all these distractions.  So Ford wanted to make it possible for you to get in the car, still be connected to Twitter  and to Slack or to Pandora, to still be able to participate in the world, you know, get  traffic directions, turn by turn directions, make phone calls, but safely without going,  you know, while you're driving.  So keep your hands on the wheel, your eyes on the road, you press that button on your  wheel.  You could do almost anything.  It's just incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Listen to music.  Yes.  So this means that unlike OnStar, which has to have a separate cell account, basically,  with the Ford, you're just using your cell phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  So for instance, okay, so, you know, that's the thing about OnStar is if you have an,  this is where they sell in all their ads, you have a record, you know, you can call  emergency.  Ford has this 911 assist.  Once it's paired with your cell phone, if the airbags are deployed, it makes a call  to 911.  It sends the GPS data to the 911.  Many 911 centers are able to get that.  So immediately, you know, this is one of the problems with the 911, with the cell phone  They don't know where the hell you are.  So with this, the GPS data from sync goes to the 911.  It sends a recorded message saying airbags have been deployed and then gives you the  opportunity to speak if you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So architecturally, what makes so much sense about that is that you don't want to have  to have five separate SIM cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Precisely.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Precisely.  And there's no additional subscription fee.  You don't have to use the phone to do your laptop tethering, to do all this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly.  It's true hands-free calling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can buy a dual SIM for your car and your phone, but if both are on, neither works.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So no, it's just whatever my phone.  And by the way, it can be whatever your phone du jour is.  You can pair up to 99 phones.  And so if you're somebody like me, I even paired my iPad to my sync.  So I listen to music on my iPad.  And the phone still works.  I still have the phone capability with my phone.  So I've got two things paired.  It's very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You probably paired your Newton with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm an over-pairer.  Over-pairer.  So that's enough of that.  Sync available exclusively, Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles.  Check it out or go to SyncMyRidePodcast.com.  Ford sent us to E3, sponsored our coverage.  And we have some great coverage of E3.  You can see more of that on the specials feed, twit.tv slash specials.  Our E3 coverage is available there.  twit.tv slash specials.  It was kind of fun.  You know, one of the things that was needed, and this has nothing to do with Google, but  it was cool, the Microsoft Connect thing, which seems dorky where you dance in front  of the Xbox.  But it's actually really fun and very sweaty.  I can only imagine.  Well, this is, you know what?  In a way, I think this is good news because there's quite a few people in this country  anyway who spend a little more.  Spend a little time in front of the screen.  And this gets you jumping and moving.  And it's hard work.  They've got, but they have some good exercise stuff.  If you do yoga on the Connect, it looks at your pose.  It's got two cameras.  It's got a Z-axis camera, an RGB camera, and it's got a ray microphone.  So it can see, it knows where you are in space.  It knows what your face is.  It recognizes your face.  So when you step in and it assigns an avatar to you, you step out.  Somebody else steps in, their avatar comes up.  Two people step in and it says, oh, there's two people there.  Puts both avatars up.  You can play.  It's really pretty sweet stuff.  And so if you're doing a yoga pose, it actually analyzes and it won't go on until you get  the pose right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's unlock the pose.  That sounds really neat.  There were two games I played.  There's a river rafting game and an obstacle course.  In the obstacle course, you have to duck under things, jump over things, dodge out of the  way.  It's very physical.  I worked up a sweat, but it was actually kind of strangely fun.  You look like an idiot.  You should only do it with friends and family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you should record this as raw video feed of you and just put it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Without knowing that I'm doing it.  Right.  Well, that's the other thing.  It takes pictures of you.  You know how like when you are on the water slide at Disneyland at the end when you're  screaming and you're really unhappy and it takes a picture of you and they sell it to  you for $25?  This does the same thing.  It snaps a picture of you going like this, this and then at the end of the game, you  see all of images of you.  It's pretty fun.  You're like, I hate this thing.  I hate this.  I hate it.  I hate it.  It was pretty fun stuff, I have to say.  And of course, Sony's doing the thing with his Sony move.  And you know, Nintendo's got 3D.  There's so much money in games.  Time for our tool tip and number of the week.  We'll start with Gina's tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right.  All right.  You know, I talked about this Android keyboard called Shapewriter, which you kind of you  swipe your finger back and forth to type if you're not good at the touch keyboard.  And it's not in the Android market anymore.  But the other product, which is similar, which is the keyboard is called Swipe with a Y,  they are offering an official beta for the next couple of days.  So if you go to beta.swipe.com, you have to register, you have to put in your email address  and they email you a link to download the beta, but it's available to try out.  So right now, Swipe and Shapewriter are not available in the market.  But if you sign up for this beta now, and I think it probably won't be around only this  week, I think you'll be able to try it out.  I get a few emails about Shapewriter, people saying, well, why isn't it in the market anymore?  I'm not really sure what happened to it.  But it looks like Swipe is getting ready to do a full release.  But you can try out the beta now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Backstory on this, of course, you you outed Swipe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did.  I mentioned an unofficial download of Swipe and they weren't too happy about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And yeah, so then you switch to Shapewriter and you like Shapewriter, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I did.  Yeah, I did.  I did.  Shapewriter felt just as good as Swipe.  But I'm happy to see that Swipe is opening up beta to folks and doing a kind of official  beta and having people test.  So you can get in on that now.  Basically right now, if you want to try one of these keyboards, the Swipe beta is really  your only option as far as I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you move?  Did you try it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm still using Shapewriter, but I just I just actually submitted my email address.  So I'm going to try it.  I'm going to give Swipe a number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some phones, we should say some phones do come installed with Swipe.  Yes.  And they're in fact, I think some Windows mobile phones have Swipe.  I think it is a sense it's a better way of doing it.  So instead of trying to hit that key, you slide your finger around and it's got a smart  algorithm.  Essentially, it says, oh, that shape, that's this word.  Exactly.  You're drawing a shape.  It's a very clever idea, I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I've been using it for a long time for months now and I'm really I'm a lot faster  doing it that way with Shapewriter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So now I just wish I could turn on my Nexus one because I'd really like to install this.  I literally from I went from somebody with like eight phones to somebody with no phone.  I have no phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you get the Evo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Evo was a Sprint loaner, which went back.  My iPhone I lent to Abby when she left hers back east and she lost it.  Oh, I guess I could take the sim out of this and put I have a Nokia and nine hundred.  But I don't know.  That's such a thing is like carrying around a suitcase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People are going to laugh at you on the street.  They will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is that?  What is that monster phone you're using?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'll be driving down in your Mustang and they'll be hooting at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's from Sweden.  No, it's not.  It's from Finland.  Our number of the week, Mr. JJ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  9.5 million.  Piper Jaffrey's Gene Muster, the analyst, upped his estimate of iPhone sales in iPhone  or iPad and in 30 iPhone or iPad phone for sales.  Nine point five million by 30.  He estimates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, after six hundred thousand in the for preorders in the first day, you know, Apple,  the rumor is Apple ordered more of these made than they've ever done before.  Why?  Well, isn't doesn't everybody who has one want one have one?  What's the I mean?  Crack.  It's crack.  It is crack.  It's time to upgrade 600, 700 bucks for me to upgrade.  What should we should always we should always ask anybody who's on the show.  What do you use, Chris?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, actually, I'm still rocking the iPhone 2G.  It's got four gigs of RAM.  Wow.  Kind of like having a four megabyte hard drive.  It's a good discipline.  It is actually, you know, it's kind of like I test all the Google Web apps and the mobile  apps on it and I provide plenty of feedback to the team to let them know ways in which  they could be improving these applications and making them faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's actually really good that somebody takes a bullet for the team that way and uses older,  slower.  It hurts.  But but it's but you need to use older, slower hardware so that people who have two G's don't  get left in the cold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we get spoiled a lot, you know, because we get to upgrade whenever we want.  So well, not whenever, but we get to upgrade, let's say.  And it's always the case that everyone has that ability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a really good point.  I should I should maybe break out my old flip phone and just just see how it feels.  Life is like normal people.  What is the oldest phone I had?  Actually I have a G1, but I lent it to a friend who lost his phone.  But when I get the G1 back, maybe that's see that's what I mean.  Actually, I had eight phones in here two weeks ago and I have zero now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was going to say for someone with so much kit, it's already gear.  You're phoneless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They can't get the iPhone out soon enough.  My my tool of the week.  Well, I mentioned one, which is a double twist and everybody should get the double twist  application on your on your Android phone.  It really is a great phone.  But this is kind of a fun one.  If I can find it here, it's kind of chat roulette for Street View.  There's actually two ways to do this.  There's a plug-in you could use in Google Chrome.  Unfortunately, my experience with the plug-in is that it's so randomized.  So it randomly pulls up a Street View.  It's so randomized that it pulls up a lot of places, at least when I was trying it,  that didn't have a Street View.  So you get you got a lot of blanks, which is kind of not fun.  And then there's one called Street View funny at Street View funny dot com that they must  be somehow vetting the Street View because it's just like chat roulette, but you get  a Street View every time.  So I said, there it is.  Now these these seem to be all in the UK, unfortunately.  Maybe that's why you get a Street View every time.  So I'll put links to both of those in our friend feed feed.  It's kind of fun to just randomly see a Street View.  Okay, I'm easily amused.  It's like touring the UK on a budget.  And the good news is no male genitalia pops up.  It's just amazing.  You could try and try.  Did you see that?  You see the guy who wrote chat roulette is trying to write a plug in that auto senses  male genitalia and blocks it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, somebody I think Business Insider did a contest, try to find the means to solve  it.  And the winning suggestion was that you do face recognition and you figure if there's  a face, there's no penis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, unless your penis looks like a face.  That's another matter entirely a subject for another show, I believe.  Chris I'm so sorry we degenerated to this point, but we do thank you so much for being  here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what the internet's for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, and he should know he's open web advocate at Google and I didn't know what he was advocating  and now I have an idea if you want to find out more about Christmas in a factory Joe  com is his website, follow him on Twitter.  I do it really is a worthwhile feed at factory Joe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or actually, no, you got me wrong.  It's at Christmas in a now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you changed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I became me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did it do that automatically?  Because I know I'm senior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It must have.  Yeah, but every now and then I see you give me a little out reply and factory john.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got to fix that.  Yeah, no, I'm following you.  I just, huh, okay.  I always think of you as factory Joe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's all right.  It's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a legacy thing.  Do you stay in touch with the flock folks at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Every now and then, you know, not too often, but I sometimes see those guys out and about.  And it's really interesting that of course, you know, as we said before, they're built  on chromium.  So happy I'm going to move.  We've got some DNA strands in common now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I'm going to move because I have to say I love flock.  I used flock for a long time, but I was kind of I'm getting off that Firefox platform.  I just it's such a pig.  And I'm a chrome fanatic.  So yeah, I'll absolutely.  Well, they have to do it on the Mac, but I'll put it on my Windows machines anyway.  Thank you, Chris.  Chris Messina from Google.  Thank you, Jeff Jarvis in Berlin today where it is late at night.  So I'll let you go to bed.  Good night.  Jeff's book is What Would Google Do?  His blog is buzzmachine.com.  The new book.  Are you working on an array?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm trying to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was trying to remember the name of it.  Do you have public parts?  Public parts.  Yeah, that's the opposite of private parts.  So should be able to remember that.  Thank you, Jeff.  Always great to have you here.  Couldn't do the show without you or Gina Tripani, who is the author of The Complete  Guide to Google Wave, complete wave guide dot com.  Also blogging at smarterware dot org.  What are you excited about right now?  These days?  What?  What?  Anything?  Because you always you have these you have this passion for what you do.  And I'm always curious, what is getting Gina interested today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm morphing from a blogger to a coder again.  So I'm just really excited about like design patterns and object oriented design.  Patterns, I can't really tweet about because people will just be like, I think patterns,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you know, I did all my programming, you know, way back when patterns is very interesting.  I love that.  I'm starting to buy patterns books.  Factory patterns.  Yeah, you collect patterns.  I used to buy the cookbooks, right?  You know, the Pearl cookbook, the Python cookbook.  Now you buy patterns books.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I'm just I'm sort of relearning a bunch of coding things that are like whatever people  actual coders are like, yeah, that was like so five years ago.  And then people are like, what are you talking about?  So whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like saying, I just discovered this thing called bubble sort.  It's amazing.  It's incredible.  Do you have a Gina patterns account on Twitter?  You should.  Seriously, this is a new thing that I you know, people are starting to do where you  You have your main Twitter account, but you realize that if you start tweeting about patterns,  people are going to glaze, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, right.  So you make up the like, yeah, the like, I can tweet about anything I want, you know,  coding wise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Steve Gibson does that with the pads with Slates.  He says, I'm going to have a slate.  Anything.  Anytime I want to mention Slate, I won't do it on my main account because I know that's  going to make people crazy.  Have a pattern.  You could have Gina's pattern of the day.  I won't mock you.  I promise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know if I need another Twitter account, but yes, I like that idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
