[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680]   This is this Week in Tech, Episode 7.
[00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.680]   Recorded June 2nd, distributed June 4th, 2005.
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.240]   The BBC would like to announce that the next scene is not considered suitable for family viewing.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.920]   And it looks as though we're in for a splendid afternoon sport on this, the 127th, up on Class
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.080]   Twitter the Year, Chef.
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.840]   And now for something completely different.
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.400]   We are all Twitch now.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.920]   For that, great!
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:24.920]   Twitch!
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.520]   Excellent.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.520]   Yeah.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.520]   Look out!
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:41.520]   Is everybody's recording?
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.520]   Yes, recording.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.520]   Okay.
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.520]   And here's Slamdance's industry.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.520]   I'm calling him again, I don't know.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.520]   Oh, he just popped up saying he signed on, so...
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.520]   Oh, good.
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.520]   Yeah, well, I see him.
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.520]   I just, he's not answering.
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.520]   I talked to Pat a little while ago.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.520]   He was playing with connectors on his mic or something.
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.520]   Yeah, he's still soldering.
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.520]   Oh, no, he has the connectors.
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.520]   Oh, I just got that 45-inch Sharp Aqua synth.
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.520]   What a lovely, lovely display.
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.520]   Oh, nice.
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.520]   1080p.
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.520]   Oh, it's 1080p.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.520]   Yeah, 45 inches.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.520]   How much?
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.520]   Yeah, 8 grand.
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.520]   8 grand.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.520]   Well, it's not bad.
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.800]   Now, I mean, it's state of the art for what Sharp's doing right now, and there aren't many displays
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.520]   you can buy right now that are, I don't think there is one larger that is actually out on
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.520]   the market yet.
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.520]   I'm going to call Robert here on P-Tip because he's the 1080p guy or 1080p tip.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.520]   Hey, the cool new trend is with a smaller flat panel, so the 37-inch.
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.520]   Everyone's shooting at 37 inches with 1080p now, and they're all for around two grand or
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.520]   less.
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.520]   So when it's 1080p, that means that the native resolution of the screen from top to bottom
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.520]   is at least 1,080 pixels.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.520]   Right.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.520]   Are they typically more than that or?
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.520]   No, it's usually 1920 by 1080 for fixed pixel formats.
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.520]   Can plasmid?
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.520]   Are they doing any plasmids with that resolution?
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.520]   Sure, but it's up in the 70-plus-inch range, which is $50,000 on up.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.520]   Okay.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.520]   So if you want 1080p and you're going to start seeing more and more 1080p, I def, I'll see
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.520]   these the way to go.
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.520]   I really hope that's going.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.520]   I mean, Windows Media, give them credit for their high definition effort at least, but
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.520]   at least they include 1080p in all their published formats or as far as what you can buy in
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.520]   the world.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.520]   Like the Terminator 2 disc and I'm also watching, oh, what is it called?
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.520]   Coral Reef Adventure.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.520]   The Coral Reef Adventure.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.520]   It's a...
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.520]   It's a wild, right?
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.520]   Yeah, but it is just...
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.520]   But it's just coral reef, right?
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.520]   Yeah.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.520]   That's true.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.520]   It's lots underwater.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.520]   Is Schwartz an egg or an egg?
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.520]   Liam Neeson narrating it.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.520]   See, this was, remember when HD first came out and you'd go to the trade shows and all
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.520]   these Japanese companies would be there with aquariums.
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.520]   It's like, come on.
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.520]   We want something.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.520]   I mean, you don't buy an HD TV to watch fish.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.520]   No.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.520]   I don't think.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.880]   Well, PC graphics too initially pushed it on just because you could do, you already had
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.360]   high def in a PC and if you could just come up with the right format graphic, it would
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.760]   look pretty sharp.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.280]   The problem I'm running into actually with that sharp 46 inch right now or 45 inch is
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.280]   that even though it's 1080p, I don't believe DVI or any digital format currently supports
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.040]   1080p as far as I can tell.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.720]   Oh, you mean you can't put it out of anything that you've got?
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.320]   Well, I can do it through component, but not digitally right now, which is something I,
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.000]   like the native PC resolutions 12 by 10.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Why would that be?
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.560]   I mean, digital isn't specified what the resolution is.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.400]   I think it's a bandwidth issue to be perfectly honest with the current spec, especially with
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.200]   DVI, unless certain with HDMI, that's something I'm looking into right now.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.080]   You know, if it's DVI, it's going to be HDMI because it's the same thing.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.400]   It's just a different electrical connector, right?
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.400]   It should.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.520]   No, I mean, it is totally backward compatible, but I was a little bummed that I couldn't
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.200]   just simply turn my PC on with a DVI connection to 1080p.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.200]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.360]   That's a real limitation.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.920]   But I'm willing to bet I can do it with a component.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.040]   I'm about to find out anyway.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.280]   Patrick just sent me a note saying he blew his power supply.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.200]   Don't tell me switching to another system.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.360]   Patrick's having some problems.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.360]   I'm having weightly.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.160]   Hey, I have to tell you something.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.760]   I feel a little guilty here.
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.440]   I actually bought a PC laptop.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.360]   And worse than that, it's a tablet PC.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.360]   Oh, no.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.360]   Oh, I know.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.280]   I feel like I've gone over to the other side.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.280]   Hey, man.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.280]   Hey, there he is.
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.280]   Okay.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.280]   I went on vocals every one.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.360]   I did something stupid and blew up a power supply.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.720]   Now Patrick, are you as your recorder on right now?
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.720]   What's that?
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.360]   Don't say anything unless your recorder is on.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.360]   I can't.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.360]   Oh.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.600]   I realize that I can't find the adapter for the microphone.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:48.000]   Patrick's the only one who got a microphone that actually came with a connector.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.720]   With a quarter inch connector.
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.000]   And you say you can't.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.520]   Oh, I see you don't have a headphone adapter.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.520]   I have a good four or five of them.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.560]   But right now I started packing up my house.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.560]   Patrick, I don't care.
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.560]   Just to move.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.720]   Still plug in the recorder and record yourself on the...
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.720]   Okay.
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.600]   Because at least we'll get a high quality recording that way.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.600]   Okay.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.600]   I have seven.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.600]   No, actually.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.600]   Oh, yeah, it isn't there.
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.040]   And then turn it to MP3 64 kilobits.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.200]   Already did that.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.200]   Yeah, so that way you'll get enough on there.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.720]   I spent the 45 minutes working through the manual to get that set up.
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.400]   So ladies and gentlemen, this is like the part in Wizard of Oz where it goes from black
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.400]   and white to color.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.200]   Patrick Knight Norton's about to go from Skype to high quality audio.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.240]   Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.240]   That's better.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.240]   Okay.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.240]   Hey guys.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.240]   Yeah.
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.240]   So I got a hot tip for everybody.
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.720]   Seriously hot tip.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.320]   If you're going to stop the fan on your big expensive computer so that the wine from
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.560]   the really loud power supply you haven't replaced, even though you have a brand new power supply
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.840]   sitting in the room with you that you haven't installed yet.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.840]   When you're using that little removable steel tab that you know the card slot cover, don't
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:06.880]   stick it in too far or there'll be a loud pop and that your power will stop.
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.920]   So you're using the card slot to physically stop the fan?
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.440]   Well now I'm not because the power supply's dead.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.520]   Dude, you're shooting for a Darwin award.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.240]   You just catch up on that part of my life.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.800]   Part of the fun of working with Patrick is the risk.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.880]   Hey, somebody gave me a revision point one motherboard that wasn't a brand new box and
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.760]   I went and installed it and I'm having more issues than I care to describe right now.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.760]   And I realized it is a revision point one so they probably got free before it ever came
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.720]   out and I'm ready to throw it out the window.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.400]   Have you guys heard about the bad caps problem?
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.320]   Oh, where they were having problems, the capacitor is blowing up.
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.320]   What do you think of that?
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.960]   Is that BS or is that the real deal?
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.400]   That was really about a year or two ago.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.440]   You don't, so it's all better now?
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.600]   There was just a significant issue.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.080]   There was the whole problem where they would leak and become an A, it's pretty corrosive
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.560]   material inside of there.
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.520]   Badcaps.net is the website.
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.120]   So you think that that's all water under the bridge?
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.360]   I mean as soon as it came to light it seemed that there was an immediate reaction.
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.720]   Everybody took a good look at who's brand they were using and putting a little more
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.560]   quality I think into that one part.
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.560]   Yeah, these are pretty old.
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.560]   I'm looking at it now.
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.560]   They're our pretty old motherboard.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.800]   Well, it's kind of scary when you think about, I mean, you know, you think about the amount
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.360]   of little tiny parts that go together to make a motherboard, you know, or an MP3 player
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.920]   or of, you know, video recorder.
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:33.920]   If somebody screws up or run a capacitors, yeah, two-bar resistors.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.920]   Two-bar resistors.
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.920]   Yeah.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:36.920]   Well, and that's what happened.
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.720]   Apparently there's a batch of leaky capacitors that got into a bunch of motherboards.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.720]   Quality control.
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.720]   Yeah.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.720]   Well, yeah.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.640]   Well, and especially when, you know, your margins are razor thin and you're trying to
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.640]   crank this stuff out.
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.640]   It's true.
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.520]   And they don't want to recall the parts and replace them like they should.
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:53.920]   Well, that's true too.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.920]   Well, they learned that from, you know, Detroit.
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.520]   Yeah, I saw a Fight Club.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.520]   Yeah.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.520]   I know how the automobile industry works.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.120]   Take the cost or recall.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.120]   Actually lawsuits.
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.320]   Well, Patrick, you're going to be mad at me.
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.120]   I bought a tablet PC.
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.320]   I'm not mad at you.
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.320]   I'm laughing at you.
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.520]   I have a question.
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.720]   Here's the worst part.
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.320]   Well, at least you're away from Tiger now.
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.320]   I kind of like it.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.720]   Do you using it to browse in the bathroom?
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.920]   Do you take it in the bathroom with you in the mornings?
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:23.920]   Yeah.
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.120]   I think there needs to be a 12-step program for me for a tablet PC.
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.120]   It's like, I can't stop using.
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.720]   So you're drawing on the screen all the time?
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:35.320]   Well, you know what I bought it for is for the TV show.
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.320]   Because I wish we'd had these when we were doing the screen savers.
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.600]   So you can bring up a web page and hold it up to the camera and point and just
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.320]   digulate and do all the stuff they tried to make us do with that.
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.120]   With a football problem?
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.120]   Yeah.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.600]   So, yeah, basically, and also it's flat.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.240]   So it doesn't, you know, it's not like this big honking thing sitting in front of you.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.320]   You're just holding a tablet.
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.800]   And so I think particularly for Amber's web workshop, it's going to be really great because
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.520]   she shows sites.
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.920]   She can highlight circle.
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:06.440]   I put Visio on it so she can use Visio to quickly do mock-ups and stuff.
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.880]   I think it's going to be a good way to do that kind of stuff anyway.
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:09.880]   Well, sure.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:14.720]   You're a vertical industry Leo, much like hospitals and insurance adjusters.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.640]   I kind of like it.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.480]   You know, the ink is kind of neat.
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.560]   You write your stuff.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:26.880]   And I'm using one note and the Franklin Planner folks have a day planner program.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.400]   And it holds the ink.
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.080]   And then if you want to turn it into text, it does a fairly good, you know, it's a lot
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.080]   better than the Newton.
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.800]   What's the battery life on it?
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:38.400]   I got an HP, the 4200, I think TC4200.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.920]   And it's a Pentium M. And I'm getting about three hours.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.600]   It's not a huge, but it's a tiny battery.
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.920]   You're going to have to get a supplementary battery.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.040]   But it's a little, you know, it's a small one.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:53.040]   It's not a big one.
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:58.040]   It's 1024x768, 12 inch screen.
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.040]   And you said it's definitely better than the Newton.
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.040]   It is better than the Newton.
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.040]   It's kind of cool.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:07.040]   You know, but now Patrick, you have to explain to me because you're the one who always said
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:12.040]   never, you know, you like these little micro notebooks, sub notebooks that don't have spindles.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.040]   They don't have a CD.
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.040]   How do you install stuff on it?
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:19.040]   So you get into the really sub sub notebook.
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.040]   I don't even know what you call them.
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:25.040]   The ones that are running like the three quarter screens where it's 1024x760 or, you know, 620
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.040]   stuff like that.
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.040]   That's what I have.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.040]   Yeah.
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:32.040]   It's getting really hard to actually find a five pound notebook that doesn't have an optical
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.040]   spindle in it anymore.
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.840]   I think it should because I would like to be able to, you know, I mean, I got this for
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.240]   the TV show so it's not as critical.
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.040]   But I think if I were going to buy one all the time, I want one that has a DVD player
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.040]   and a CD burner.
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.040]   Right.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.040]   So my IBM T40 has, I love that.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.040]   Yeah.
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.040]   That's a great notebook.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.040]   Just small enough and it's tough.
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.040]   And the keyboard's awesome.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.040]   T series is an amazing series for IBM.
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.040]   That and a little light they put at the top of the screen, you can turn on and off because
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.040]   I work in a dark, you know, dark lab with the...
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.040]   But I like the tablet, but it's not a tablet, right?
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.040]   It's just a regular laptop.
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.040]   Yeah.
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.040]   This is a convertible.
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.040]   So you get the kind of the best of both worlds as long as the hinge doesn't break.
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.040]   Which I'm sure...
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.040]   Can you guys still handle 1024x768?
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.040]   I can't take it anymore.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.040]   I cannot work on anything that's 1024x760.
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.040]   Yeah, I can.
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.040]   But I'm not small enough.
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.040]   I'm old.
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.040]   I have bad eyes.
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.040]   When you get too high a res for me, I can't see everything's too tiny.
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:23.040]   Yeah, it depends on the res, but I haven't been able to find that many laptops.
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.040]   It's important to like 16x12.
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.040]   The new, you might like the new...
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.040]   There's a new tablet PC, I think it's a Toshiba.
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.040]   It's that 16x12.
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.040]   16x12 is really small.
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.040]   I mean, that's a really...
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.040]   That's a lot of resolution for...
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.040]   But anything for...
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.040]   Young eyes, Kevin.
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.040]   Yeah, anything like...
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.040]   I'm using...
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.040]   What is it?
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.040]   It's a 18-inch monitor.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.040]   Yeah.
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:48.040]   And I find that's just about kind of a perfect balance without having to, you know, boost
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.040]   the DPI or anything to achieve.
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.040]   Well, you can always do that.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.040]   You can make the, you know, eye context bigger and all that stuff.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.040]   I mean, you don't have to...
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.040]   But you know what?
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:59.040]   It kind of screws up some of the menus that pop up and things like that.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:04.040]   But it doesn't scale everything properly, which I guess Apple supposedly does a little
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.040]   bit better, which wouldn't surprise me.
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.040]   Well, I ran into a big problem with it.
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.040]   I was helping a friend by a laptop for doing CAD work.
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:14.040]   And he had to have a minimum of 1280 by 1024 for the program to work.
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:20.040]   And so he ended up having to go with like Voodoo's like $5,000 absolute top of the line
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:23.040]   card with the Quadra FX card in it.
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.040]   Wow.
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:31.040]   I normally found that when I was looking for a laptop, I have a Dell, a 600D.
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:34.040]   And it was like a custom option that you had to order, you know, it was like the...
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.040]   What do they call that?
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.040]   Like the SXGA plus screen?
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.040]   That's just a 15-inch monitor.
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.040]   Extra hundred bucks or so, but I think...
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.040]   Well, that's not bad.
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.040]   But that was like a...
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.040]   What?
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.040]   That's a 15-inch monitor on that?
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.040]   16-inch?
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.040]   14, actually.
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.040]   Wow.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.040]   See, that's too high a resolution for 14-inches.
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.040]   I have 14-inches.
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.040]   10 by 7, and it works out just great.
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.040]   You're crazy.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.040]   Hey, interesting.
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:04.040]   One of my sponsors on the radio show is a DSL provider just announced that they are now
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:10.040]   offering normal DSL, you know, 1.5-megabit DSL for 15 bucks a month.
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.040]   I read that.
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.040]   For how long?
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.040]   SBC's done it, and so now everybody's dropping.
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.040]   Can you believe...
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.040]   Is that for six months or is that an interesting thing?
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.040]   I don't know, but SBC's do.
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:23.040]   I think SBC's a few months, but these guys are guaranteeing for a year.
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.040]   15 bucks.
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.040]   That's great.
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:30.040]   I really think we're just going to start to see Big Ten price wars in the high-speed Internet.
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.040]   It's about time.
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.040]   Yeah, because the big companies are going to kill off the little ones.
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.040]   That happened before, though.
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:42.040]   Remember, there were all these little ISPs, and now there aren't.
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.040]   Whatever happened to Vario?
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.040]   Remember Vario bought everybody?
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.040]   Are they still around?
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.040]   Yeah, they're still around.
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.040]   Are they still in ISP?
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.040]   You don't hear about?
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.040]   I don't think so.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.040]   They think about everybody.
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.040]   Hold on.
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:58.040]   I used the same person that sponsors you, so...
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:01.040]   I don't want to mention their names because it's not an ad for them at this point.
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.040]   Yeah, yeah, that's fine.
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.040]   I know who it is.
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.040]   That's why I say the same company.
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.040]   They were my residential service when I was in Oakland.
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.040]   I loved them.
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.040]   So here's the deal.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:12.040]   They're going to give me and the new...
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:16.040]   I'm moving this all next week into an outside office out of the house.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:23.040]   Because it's two blocks from the central office, I can finally get, I think, 512 up.
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.040]   So we get like three megabits down, 512 up, something like that.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.040]   Whatever their top of the line is.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.040]   And then I'm going to have it home.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.040]   I'm going to have Comcast.
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:34.040]   So it's going to be very interesting to compare the two.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.040]   I used to always like cable better.
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.040]   I don't know.
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.040]   What do you have, Kevin?
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.040]   Do you have DSLR cable?
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.040]   I have cable mode at home, but it's terrible.
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.040]   Do you have Delphia?
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.040]   No, Comcast.
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.040]   And there's too many people in your neighborhood.
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.040]   In the afternoon.
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.040]   Yeah, there's too many people.
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.040]   I'm going cable mode.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.040]   You like it?
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.040]   Robert, you said you like it or you don't like it?
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:59.040]   I think it just cut off on him.
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.040]   So now it's cable.
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.040]   That's the cable mode.
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.040]   There's the answer right there.
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.040]   Well, personally, I mean, it pretty much depends on the issue you like.
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.040]   You're a cable provider.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.040]   Yeah, I'm going to have a three megabit line here.
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.040]   So I've done that work.
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:13.040]   So Patrick, are you cable modem or DSLR?
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:19.040]   I'm DSLR because until I move to this house, I couldn't get a cable modem.
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:24.040]   And the only cable modem provider I know of in San Francisco is Comcast.
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:28.040]   And I won't give them any of my money for reasons I won't go into.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:31.040]   Hey, this is cool.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.040]   Nobody here works for Comcast now.
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.040]   No.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.040]   Yay!
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:40.040]   So we can say anything we want because nobody can get fired.
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.040]   Very true.
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:45.040]   So Kevin, big, big rollout.
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.040]   No, I'm not going to do anything.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.040]   Don't worry.
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:50.040]   Big, big rollout for system last week.
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:53.040]   You want to tell the world what happened?
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.040]   Oh, it was just madness.
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:57.040]   I can't believe what happened.
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.040]   How many people were in the chat room, right?
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:03.040]   We got up to 800 people in the IRC.
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:07.040]   But you couldn't do anything because we were being bought at the whole time.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.040]   They finally locked it down.
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:11.040]   We actually had, this was DSLXtreme who provides the chat room.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:15.040]   Really, the guy's name is Andrew.
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.040]   He's a handleistic static.
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.040]   He is one of their techs there.
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.040]   And he is an EFNet op.
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.040]   And he knows what he's doing.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.040]   And he locked it down.
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.040]   He did a great job.
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.040]   However, I've never seen 800 people.
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.040]   You know what it's like skiing?
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.040]   The tech's gone by so fast.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.040]   You feel like it's like blurring.
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:38.040]   You feel like you downhill skiing through text.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.040]   It was amazing.
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:44.040]   And people were, I know you were having a party, right, with a camera.
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.040]   Right.
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.040]   And yeah, so basically we had a little gift together.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.040]   There was probably about, oh, I don't know, a Yash.
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.040]   What was there?
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.040]   Like 15 to 20 people, something like that?
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.040]   Yeah, about that.
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:56.040]   I mean, when we were there, there was over 800 people on the IRC.
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.040]   And we were like, whoa!
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:00.040]   All the websites were getting hammered.
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.040]   Yeah.
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.040]   The system actually went down.
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.040]   The web server itself went down.
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:07.040]   But luckily we used a caching service from Prolexic.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:11.040]   And they were able to bring on multiple machines all over the place
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.040]   and kind of cache all of our content and seed our content so we stayed up.
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.040]   I saw that on your blog.
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.040]   Had you made an arrangement with them ahead of time?
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:21.040]   Or do they come to your rescue like the fire brigade?
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:27.040]   Well, actually it happened right when we went down on Ron, who's kind of our tech guy.
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:32.040]   The handles the server side of stuff made a call to our CEO, Jay, who was friends with the owner of Prolexic.
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:35.040]   And they were able to accommodate us.
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.040]   They were really stoked.
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:40.040]   It was crazy because the guys, I guess, that set it up from Prolexic were like, we're hosting system.
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.040]   That's awesome.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.040]   They were stoked about it because they had heard about it themselves.
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.040]   So it was really cool.
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.040]   They really helped us out.
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.040]   So they're like an Akamai kind of.
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.040]   They do the caching.
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:54.040]   Well, their main business, I guess, from what I understand is anti-denial service.
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:18:00.040]   If you're a Microsoft or Yahoo and someone's DDOS and you, they will basically spread the hit out
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:03.040]   and also use ways to filter out the bad packets.
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:13.040]   The key at this point with DOS, because of raw sockets, you can't really filter by IP address.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:18.040]   Even if you say it's a massively distributed denial of service attack where you have thousands of machines,
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:22.040]   even then, it's only going to be thousands of IP addresses.
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:25.040]   You can eventually lock it down by blocking those addresses.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:32.040]   But if they use raw sockets, every request, every sin is a different IP address, you can't block it.
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.040]   You can't lock it down.
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:36.040]   So the only way to solve that is to throw a band with that.
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.040]   Right.
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:40.040]   They have somewhere around a thousand servers worldwide.
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.040]   That's what you need.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.040]   Spread it out.
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.040]   And then you can throttle it.
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:49.040]   And then you can also throttle it by saying, no, if I get a sin, just sin is a request, okay, I want the page.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:54.040]   You can't block sins universally or your page is down.
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:19:01.040]   So what they do is they say, okay, we're going to, the sin flood, you only get the packet once from that IP address.
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.040]   Then that guy switches to a new IP address, or maybe twice.
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:07.040]   So the key on these is to say, oh, all right, well, I'm going to wait and make sure it's a real sin.
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:12.040]   So all waitily resends, because every normal browser will wait a little while and resend.
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.040]   So your site's slow, but it's up.
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.040]   Right.
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:18.040]   Because you basically filter out the bad sins.
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:22.040]   But yeah, so that's, but it takes a lot of bandwidth to do that.
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.040]   Yeah.
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.040]   Okay, I just got a, I am from Rob.
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:25.040]   He said he should be able to be back in.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.040]   He's on a different connection now.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.040]   All right.
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:31.040]   So let me, let me invite him back into the conference.
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:36.040]   Of course, like I said, we've been hearing him on the recorder this old time.
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.040]   He did it on the Twic-S.
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:41.040]   I'll have to, you don't have to, there we go.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:44.040]   You know, I hope you weren't talking, Robert, because now I have to edit you out of the,
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.040]   I quality version.
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:50.040]   I hope you swore to, can't do it for you.
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:54.040]   Hey, Leo, we just like, I ditched the ethernet and went to wireless and it seems to be working better.
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.040]   So interesting.
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.040]   Were you looking for information on Vario, Leo?
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.040]   Yeah.
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:05.040]   They got bought by Japan's ILECNTT.
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.040]   Oh, NTT Dokkama.
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.040]   Yeah.
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.040]   I don't know if it's NTT Dokkama.
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.040]   It's NTT Dokkama.
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.040]   It's an elephant and telegraph.
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.040]   Yeah.
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.040]   So, NTT communications, global IP network.
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:15.040]   It's followed by them.
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.040]   You're swallowed.
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.040]   Well, it's pretty scary.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:22.040]   Vario, they bought more than 54 local regional, national, international providers.
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.040]   Yeah.
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:27.040]   They were, I think, you know, angling to be the big guy.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:33.040]   And then of course, a bigger, as they, to quote, to quote the episode, what is it, episode
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.040]   one, there's always a bigger fish.
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:40.040]   Except if you're NTT Dokkama, and there isn't a bigger fish.
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.040]   Yeah.
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:43.040]   They have 125,000 mile network of backbones.
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.040]   It says, wow.
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.040]   It's kind of insane.
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.040]   Look at the global IP network.
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:53.040]   And I'm counting, like, lines across the Pacific.
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.040]   Let's see.
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:59.040]   One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, two, like, 18, I think.
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.040]   Fifteen, something like that.
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:06.040]   So we were talking about system bringing, being just huge.
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:08.040]   Do you know how many downloads you got, Kevin?
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:09.040]   I mean, it's hard to count.
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.040]   We have the tracker through BitTorrent.
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.040]   And according to BitTorrent, it's a little over 60,000.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.040]   That's great.
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.040]   Nice.
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:19.040]   And then we have all the, obviously, all the mirrors that were set up and posted.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.040]   And how big is the file?
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:27.040]   It ranges depending on you want lower high quality, but in between 50 to 150 megabytes.
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:32.040]   So 60,000 times, let's say, 100 megabytes is six terabytes.
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.040]   Is that right?
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.040]   There.
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.040]   Yeah, six terabytes.
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.040]   That's a lot of data.
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:37.040]   Holy moly.
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.040]   Chimney Christmas.
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.040]   Good golly.
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:42.040]   That's crazy.
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.040]   Holy megabytes, Batman.
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:46.040]   Have you seen anybody seen the new Batman?
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.040]   Batman begins or whatever it is?
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.040]   Anybody seen this?
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.040]   It comes out the middle of the month.
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:51.040]   Everybody's getting excited.
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.040]   They say it's good.
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:56.040]   Well, that ten minute preview they showed at the end of Smallville, the season finale,
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:58.040]   it was awesome looking.
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:59.040]   I cannot wait.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.040]   That designs me far more than Star Wars did.
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.040]   Yeah.
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.040]   Well, we've had some bad, bad man, though.
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.040]   Oh, definitely.

[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:23.040]   I don't know what to do.
[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:24.040]   I don't know what to do.
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:25.040]   I don't know what to do.
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.040]   I don't know what to do.
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:27.040]   I don't know what to do.
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:28.040]   I don't know what to do.
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.040]   I don't know what to do.
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:30.040]   I don't know what to do.
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:31.040]   I don't know what to do.
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:32.040]   I don't know what to do.
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:33.040]   I don't know what to do.
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:34.040]   I don't know what to do.
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:35.040]   I don't know what to do.
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:36.040]   I don't know what to do.
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:37.040]   I don't know what to do.
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:38.040]   I don't know what to do.
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:39.040]   I don't know what to do.
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:40.040]   I don't know what to do.
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:41.040]   I don't know what to do.
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.040]   I don't know what to do.
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:43.040]   I don't know what to do.
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:44.040]   I don't know.
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:48.040]   There's a lot of them, at least three of them, that were within a couple miles of my neighborhood
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.040]   of all shut down.
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:52.040]   Well, maybe they're coming out to the suburbs now because there's a bunch.
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:58.040]   I was driving behind a big old pickup truck that said, "You frag them on this license
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:43:59.040]   plate."
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:06.040]   Just follow him to the gaming center.
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:08.040]   We didn't really get to talk about this last week.
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:13.920]   Pentium D, the dual-core Pentium, going to the desktop, Intel says it's going to sell
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:16.200]   a million of them by the end of the year.
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:19.040]   It's the end of the line for single-core processors.
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:24.840]   Yeah, then there's almost a performance improvement if you use a couple of obscure benchmarks.
[00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:27.040]   It's expensive, yet difficult.
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:28.040]   I don't know.
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:32.600]   The benchmarks I've seen so far in Robert, you've probably been following this closer
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:33.600]   than I have.
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:40.320]   I'm not seeing much that doesn't make me want to go for a much less expensive, you know,
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:42.600]   F1 64 compared to the Pentium D.
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:44.520]   I was going to say Intel who?
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:46.600]   Is Intel in trouble?
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:52.800]   I mean, for desktop CPUs, it's losing favor with the hardcore group, definitely.
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:58.080]   With AMD's X2 coming up, that is the most powerful processor you can buy for everything.
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:44:59.640]   Is that a dual-core 64?
[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:00.640]   What is that?
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:01.640]   Yeah.
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:02.640]   Dual-core.
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:03.640]   Let's see.
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:05.560]   Actually, I think you can purchase them right now.
[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:07.320]   Let me see over at Monarch actually.
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:08.760]   I thought I had a couple of them.
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:09.840]   I'll take a quick peek.
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:15.520]   But anyway, all our performance numbers for every video encoding, audio encoding, gaming,
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:18.000]   everything just puts that chip at the forefront.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.960]   And that you don't have to have a 64-bit OS?
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:21.960]   No.
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:27.760]   And there's no reason to have a 64-bit OS right now for 99.9% of everyone out there.
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:30.600]   Well, there's lots of reasons not to like nothing works.
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:33.080]   Yeah, well, there's just no benefit yet.
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:34.800]   It's the big thing.
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:35.800]   No significant benefit.
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:39.040]   I don't know if there's a real bit of a bunch of guys that are like really huge statistical
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:41.840]   database packages who are like, "Yes, there is!"
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:42.840]   Sorry.
[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:44.200]   I need four terabytes of memory.
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:45.200]   And there are people who actually do--
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:47.040]   I think that's one of the ways Intel went wrong though, right?
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:51.040]   Is the saying, "Well, we're going to put all our efforts into 64-bit code."
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:54.600]   And AMD said, "No, X86 has lots of legs."
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:55.600]   And they stuck with it.
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:56.600]   I don't know.
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:58.080]   Intel still owns what percentage of the market?
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:45:59.640]   That's because of companies like Dell.
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:01.640]   Even Dell's looking at AMD now though.
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:02.640]   That would be--
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:04.520]   Intel still has their integrated graphics too.
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:07.920]   Would that be the bellwether if Dell suddenly says, "Yeah, we're going to do AMD?"
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:13.040]   Well, I think people still, you know, the vast buying majority and certainly IT community.
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:15.400]   Like the IT community in general are all about Intel.
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:17.400]   Well, they've got a penny a.m.
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:20.440]   I mean, this type of-- this pad is a penny a.m.
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:22.840]   I mean, that's the best laptop chip still, yes?
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:23.840]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:26.640]   The penny-- I mean, unless AMD's-- I love the--
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:28.240]   We don't know about the Tourion yet.
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:29.560]   We haven't seen benchmarks yet.
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:33.600]   Well, I love the Veritek Notebook I have except for the fact that it doesn't have a penny
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:34.600]   a.m. in it.
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:41.600]   And the new ones, they actually switched them from the AMD Athlon XPs over to Celeron M's
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:42.600]   or Celeron.
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:47.160]   Veritek, a second tier company, but they're making good products for very low prices.
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:49.640]   Well, some complaints about quality control.
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:52.760]   Maybe they don't last as long as the other guys is that.
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:55.680]   Well, I've already had to-- I've had to-- this is the first Notebook I've ever had to ship
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:59.280]   back inside the first six or seven months for repairs.
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:04.960]   The power supply plug came loose inside the case.
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:06.960]   I've heard numerous complaints about that, actually.
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:11.360]   The case itself, the plastic molding, was bent a little bit, so it scrapes against the
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:12.360]   screen.
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:14.080]   And there's nothing I can do about that.
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:20.040]   The keyboard's warped from the heat of the unit, so it's got a really interesting shape
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:21.040]   to it.
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:28.640]   But it was also $800, $850 after rebate with a half a gig of RAM, a decent processor,
[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:29.640]   12-inch screen.
[00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:32.720]   It's the ultra portable version on board 802.11G.
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:35.680]   And I mean, when it came back to the melting keyboard thing.
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:37.280]   Yeah, well, it's funny.
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:41.000]   It's most of the keyboard manufacturers for Notebooks.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.760]   I mean, because it was funny.
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:47.960]   I told you guys I've been gutting my house and throwing away all the old stuff.
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:52.960]   That box of crap has got to have some amazing stuff in it, we ever decide to give it away.
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:58.880]   But I had to have this notebook I've been saving for forever, which is one of the original
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:47:59.880]   Dell latitudes.
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:02.280]   And it's got a track ball in it.
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:05.080]   And the keyboard is amazing.
[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:08.120]   But the Notebook's like three inches thick.
[00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:11.160]   The action on that keyboard is still the closest thing to that is the keyboards they
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:15.800]   use in the IBM ThinkPads, even those are just because they have to go so thin on the Z
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:19.440]   on these if they don't spend money on the keyboards, they just fall apart.
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:21.760]   Another reason I'm buying my IBM's.
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:23.040]   I love IBM's notebook keyboards.
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:26.120]   I'm nervous about the Lenovo takeover on IBM though.
[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:28.720]   Yeah, I mean, that's the Chinese government.
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:32.560]   Speaking of governments, look what the did you see with the MPAA announced today?
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:36.960]   The Motion Picture Association of America said they're putting up 10 surveillance cameras
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:41.360]   on the streets of LA to catch DVD pirates.
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:45.760]   Can a private group put up surveillance cameras on the street?
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:50.480]   There are more surveillance cameras in the United States like per square mile to any
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:51.640]   other country in the world.
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:53.240]   I mean, you're walking down the street.
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:54.840]   They're usually put up by the city.
[00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:55.840]   No, they're not.
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:58.000]   They're put up by building owners and put up by corporations.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.320]   They're put up on the streets of LA.
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:01.320]   What do you think happens?
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:03.600]   Go walk around downtown San Francisco.
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:06.800]   There's buildings and watch the exits in every corner.
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:10.080]   What's going to be interesting is like, yeah, if they are working with the city, they have
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:13.200]   to wear the city and impose the city police are monitoring the cameras.
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:15.320]   Oh, that's funny.
[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:20.960]   My last trip to Europe when I was in Italy, every building on every corner had at least
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:22.960]   two cameras.
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:27.720]   They were everywhere.
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:31.640]   If it makes it easier for law enforcement, yeah, there is the whole big brother issue.
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:35.760]   You could monitor with your new little device that you showed on system, you could monitor
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:36.760]   those cameras.
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:38.320]   Seal the signal.
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:39.800]   Now let me ask you this.
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:43.840]   So that's what you built on the first episode of System, a device to monitor video cameras.
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:45.360]   Did you reverse that?
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:50.120]   And this is very eye spy and make it send a signal to the camera or intercept a signal
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:51.320]   and send a different signal.
[00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:52.320]   Right.
[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:56.680]   You actually have to broadcast at that frequency at that frequency and the same signal to
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:57.680]   act over.
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:58.680]   I know what you're saying.
[00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:00.680]   You're saying so that whoever's watching the security monitor, you could replace their
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:01.680]   signal.
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:02.680]   Yeah.
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:03.680]   Yeah.
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:04.680]   You could put the Flintstones up or something in theory.
[00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:05.680]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:07.480]   I'll just have to do is talk about it on your video.
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:08.480]   Yeah.
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:10.200]   All you have to do is basically boost it.
[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:13.440]   You get a camera that's transmitting the signal and put a booster on it and just overpower
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:14.440]   the heck out of it.
[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:16.800]   And anything that they have isn't going to be able to keep up with the power of that
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:17.800]   signal.
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:18.800]   You're sending out.
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:20.440]   I think that's a great idea.
[00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:21.840]   That's a very candid camera.
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:25.720]   That's kind of a 21st century punk.
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:29.280]   You watch the guard go crazy because all of a sudden, you know, something else is on
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:30.280]   there.
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:31.280]   Well, what does that FCC rule?
[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:36.200]   It says all electronic devices have to accept some form of interference or any form of interference.
[00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:37.200]   Well, and they're unregulated.
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:40.680]   I mean, that's what you're talking about and out of the, out of the, from the shadows
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:44.520]   box three is that this is unregulated frequency, right?
[00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:45.680]   So that you can do anything you want.
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:46.680]   Well, pretty much.
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:49.680]   I mean, according to FCC though, you can't increase your, it's like when we were trying
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:53.760]   to modify some antennas on air on, you know, back at G4 and they wouldn't let us, you can't
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:56.200]   increase the broadcast power, if you're on a certain amount.
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:58.120]   And that's, it's actually illegal to do that.
[00:50:58.120 --> 00:50:59.840]   There's a maximum and it's illegal.
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:05.480]   It's also illegal to use any non certified antenna, which is why they all had different,
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:07.640]   all the different pigtail connectors.
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:11.240]   I think our biggest issue though for that, that, that TV broadcasting was the fact that
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:15.800]   or it was a radio radio television, but we're, we're interrupting signals, potentially interrupting
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:18.720]   signals that were being used for commercial purposes.
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:22.360]   So it wasn't an unlicensed chunk of bandwidth.
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:29.240]   How long before someone hacks the MPAA cameras and maybe put Star Wars episode three on the
[00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:30.240]   camera?
[00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:31.240]   You know what?
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:32.240]   Amazing.
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:36.400]   Somebody's kind of like somebody's just going to walk up and just smash the front of them
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:40.960]   with a hammer, put their blanket down and start selling their pirated videos.
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:46.560]   This is from, this is from the group that said that the VCR was to the American public
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:49.920]   as the, as the Boston stranglers, to the woman home alone.
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:51.520]   And who's the real threat here?
[00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:54.680]   The Motion Picture Association of America, folks.
[00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:55.680]   Not the VCR.
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:56.680]   Jeez.
[00:51:56.680 --> 00:52:01.520]   Well, I wonder what, I mean, is it even possible to know how much money they actually
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:03.200]   lose worldwide to piracy?
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:07.200]   I mean, I understand them wanting to, you know, to protect it, but it's, it's kind of like
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:11.280]   funny because they're always doing really nickel and dime things because maybe the only
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:13.600]   place they can do them is inside the US.
[00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:17.200]   Well, how much money are they spending trying to enforce all this stuff?
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:19.400]   Well, all the lawyers are already on retainer.
[00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:26.080]   I wish they would just simply put that effort into creating more formats for us at better
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:27.400]   quality and cheaper prices.
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:29.600]   And I think the problem would solve itself.
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:34.080]   Guys, I think we're, we are running out of time.
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:35.520]   Any final thoughts from anybody?
[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:37.120]   Any plugs anybody wants to get in?
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:38.600]   Did you guys talk about Star Wars?
[00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:40.000]   Did you guys all see it last week?
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   I missed it.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   I was out.
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   I was a little busy.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.640]   Yeah, I was a little disappointed.
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:47.240]   I want to see it again.
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:49.680]   It was a lot better than the last two.
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:51.440]   Oh, definitely.
[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:52.440]   Yeah.
[00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:56.960]   I just would have liked to have seen the emergence of the dark Darth, the, you know, the mass
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:58.880]   Darth Vader a lot sooner in the movie.
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:01.200]   Yeah, that's what we all want to see him.
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:02.200]   Mm-hmm.
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:24.280]   Forget Princess Amad
[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:31.280]   or twins.
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:33.280]   I mean, is that kind of freaky?
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:34.280]   It creeps me out.
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:35.280]   I don't know.
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:38.280]   Because one has brown hair and one has yellow hair and they don't look like-
[00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:41.280]   But there were a lot, there were this love interest at the beginning and it's like, ooh,
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:42.280]   I don't know.
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:45.280]   Well, that's where Han steps in and goes, oh, sister.
[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:46.280]   Cool.
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:47.280]   Hey, yeah.
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:48.280]   You get a cute sister, man.
[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:50.280]   You just got to treat a Jedi sister at her, you know, home mess you up.
[00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:52.280]   And your mama's pretty cute too.
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:55.280]   Even if she's a Yale graduate.
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:55.280]   La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:54:15.280]   Well, yeah, right?
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:16.280]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:17.280]   Well, that would happen.
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:18.280]   Are there female Jedi masters?
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:19.280]   Are there female Jedi masters?
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:20.280]   Who?
[00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:21.280]   Weren't there?
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:22.280]   I thought there were in the- in episode two.
[00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:23.280]   Yeah, there were some.
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:24.280]   In episode three, yeah.
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:25.280]   Let's just go.
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:26.280]   All right.
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:28.280]   Thanks, Leo, for inviting me up.
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:32.280]   I just want to tell you, for inviting me up to Canada, that was a lot of fun.
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:33.280]   Call for help was great.
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:37.280]   Yeah, in fact, watch Call for help because he'll be on it soon, I think.
[00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:39.280]   I can't remember when those shows air, but yeah.
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:45.280]   Showing us how he does system and the little more spying device that you made.
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:46.280]   That'll be fun.
[00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:47.280]   Yeah.
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:48.280]   And are you going to come back at some point?
[00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:49.280]   What's that, Leo?
[00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:50.280]   You're going to come back?
[00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:51.280]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:52.280]   If you'll have me back.
[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:53.280]   Anytime.
[00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:55.280]   So I'm standing offered to all of you.
[00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:58.280]   Anytime you're in the mood of Toronto, I can't pay your way.
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:54:59.280]   I'll buy you dinner.
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:01.280]   That's all I can do.
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:03.280]   But anytime you want to come to Toronto, you're welcome.
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:04.280]   Yeah.
[00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:08.280]   Hey, I apologize to all our listeners for being a little late on the Twitcast, but Memorial
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:13.280]   Day, and I was down on Bourbon Street, and I didn't wake up until Tuesday, so.
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:15.280]   He's drinking.
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:21.280]   You know, actually, in all honesty, Bourbon Street is a little over the top.
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:23.280]   I mean, they're people just stumbling drunk.
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:24.280]   All of it.
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:25.280]   It's like a fret party.
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:26.280]   We're in Bourbon Street.
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:27.280]   New Orleans.
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:30.280]   Yeah, it's like that year round last time I checked.
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:31.280]   A fret party.
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:32.280]   I was kind of appalled.
[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:35.280]   I mean, I'm no prude, but boy.
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:39.280]   Isn't that the city that's going to disappear into the ocean in 20 years?
[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:40.280]   Is it?
[00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:43.280]   Well, they've been saying that since the Civil War.
[00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:46.280]   Yeah, well, I mean, the whole, they've been building bigger and bigger dikes around the
[00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:50.280]   perimeter of the city to keep the water out, but at some point it's just going to go away.
[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:51.280]   Yeah, it's going to buy you.
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:52.280]   I had a great time.
[00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:56.280]   I met a lot of people who listed the Twitcast, so things are going in.
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:58.280]   Well, with that, I think.
[00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:03.280]   Not quite six terabytes yet, but it's a smaller file, so.
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:04.280]   Six terabytes.
[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:05.280]   I love that band.
[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:07.280]   Congratulations on your success, Kevin, with System.
[00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:09.280]   Congratulations on your new job, Yoshi.
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:12.280]   Congratulations on your new apartment or house.
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:13.280]   What is it, Patrick?
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:15.280]   Oh, it's going to be right in another house.
[00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:16.280]   That's exciting.
[00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:17.280]   Yes.
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:19.280]   We'll get you into the home buyer market pretty soon here.
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:20.280]   Hey, you know what?
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:22.280]   Soon as I win that lottery ticket.
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:25.280]   Robert Herron, congratulations on the new action figure.
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:27.280]   Pull my string.
[00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:30.280]   [laughter]
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:31.280]   Ew.
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:33.280]   It's another Twitcast for another week.
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:37.280]   We'll be back back on Sunday next week.
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:39.280]   Ladies and gentlemen, with technology.
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:40.280]   It's this question.
[00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:42.280]   The Twit Broadcasting Network.
[00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:46.280]   We now return you to your regularly broadcast program.
[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:56.280]   [music]
[00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:58.280]   That's it for this edition of This Week in Tech.
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:56:59.280]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:00.280]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:01.280]   Sorry about the late delivery.
[00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:03.280]   I promise to get it out on time.
[00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:05.280]   Tomorrow, we have our next edition.
[00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:08.280]   If you'd like to send us a question, we will be using questions.
[00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:09.280]   Again, I promise.

[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:38.280]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Tech.
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:54.280]   [music]
[00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:56.280]   I got a good topic for next week.
[00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:59.280]   Have you guys seen all the new airport security stuff popping up?
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:01.280]   A lot of it we already know about.
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:05.280]   The one that's really getting everyone crazy is that millimeter wave radar that they can
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:08.280]   go through clothing but not skin.
[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:12.280]   It bounces back off, so basically they're going to be staring at naked people all day.
[00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:15.280]   I've actually applied for the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:17.280]   [laughter]
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:19.280]   Let's talk about it next week.
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:20.280]   That's good.
[00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:21.280]   We have a good one.
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:22.280]   That's a good tease.
[00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:23.280]   Next week.
[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:24.280]   [laughter]
[00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:25.280]   She's clear, Bob.
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:26.280]   It's just a piercing.
[00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:27.280]   [laughter]
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:29.280]   Wrap yourself in foil.
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:31.280]   Is that a prosthetic?
[00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:33.280]   He's wrapped in foil, boys.
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:35.280]   That was real.
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:36.280]   [laughter]
[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:37.280]   Secondary search.
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:40.280]   [laughter]
[00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:42.280]   Well, this has been delightful.
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:43.280]   You guys.
[00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:44.280]   [laughter]
[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:45.280]   People scared me.
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:46.280]   This was good.
[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:47.280]   We got a good one.
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:48.280]   I'll talk to you later.
[00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:49.280]   You guys, I'm out of here.
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:50.280]   Good to be back.
[00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:51.280]   All right, later.
[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:52.280]   How are you?
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:53.280]   Hang on.
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:54.280]   [mumbling]
[00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:55.280]   [laughter]
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:56.280]   I'm trying to find the quid button.
[00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:57.280]   [laughter]
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:58.280]   I'm trying to find the quid button.
[00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:05.280]   Three, two, one, stop.
